        "text": " We had a great time in our¬†collaborative¬†planning session this week, moving one of our Year 5 inquiry units into the 21st century. It‚Äôs an exploration of plants and how they grow, in conjunction with hands-on work in our school kitchen-garden, and an inquiry into the environmental conditions that affect plant growth. What‚Äôs changed?  They used to‚Ä¶ do leaf rubbings with paper and pencil to see what leaves look like. Now they will use an iPad magnifier¬†app to look at leaves up close. They used to‚Ä¶ draw diagrams and label the parts of a plant. Now they will choose their own species, research it themselves and create an animated slideshow of its parts. They used to‚Ä¶. grow bean plants and watch them grow. Now they will take a photo of their beans every day and create a stop motion video showing the growth process. They used to‚Ä¶ do experiments related to plant growth and write¬†scientific reports for the teacher. Now they will film their experiments and upload them to their class blogs with their reports, to enable comments from the wider community. They used to‚Ä¶ read about different kinds of plants that grow in other places and how they adapt to their environment. Now they will message people around the world to send a photo of a plant that grows where they live, so that they can discuss and analyse their findings. In each case, it is the learning that drives the technology. In each case, the students will be more engaged.¬†In each case, the learning will be richer and deeper. Let me know if you are willing to send a photo next month, especially if you live in an environment different from ours here in Melbourne!"

The plan looks like the students will bring their own knowledge and experiences to the Inquiry, and are never considered ‚Äòblank slates‚Äô. The ICT tools will be used to connect with other thinkers like themselves, who notice what‚Äôs going on in their own backyard. The online publishing/posting will be more than ‚Äòshow and tell‚Äô blogging when the students explain the process of their own learning and change in thinking ‚Äì how exciting!Will the students choose their own method of research and presenting with their own preferred ICT tools and learning styles? How difficult is this for the classroom teacher to manage?As always, thanks for the opportunity to think and contribute.CheersBrette"

As far as choice is concerned, we recently ran a session showing the Year 5s a range of presentation tools and gave them time to explore in pairs how they work. Gradually building up a toolbox to allow the learners more choice in how they do things.The ICT facilitator and teacher librarian (ours is much more than that) were in the session and they know what support is required. They both work on flexible timetables, meaning teachers can invite and book them to work with whole class or small groups, as required. (Or even one on one with teachers themselves).Thanks for the support and conversation, as always."

I just want to suggest that we also need to provide what Schiller called an aesthetic education  ‚Äì one that sensitises children to the world beyond technology and the world beyond chatter. With every class we do things like planting trees once a year and afterwards I get the kids to switch off all their mobile devices, take out their earphones, and sit down in silence for two minutes just to listen to the sound of the wind blowing through the pine needles. It is a unique sound (and impossible to record on a mobile phone). I also insist that once a year we meet up at night on the hillside and lie down in silence to watch the stars (again, impossible to photograph or digitally record the experience). I say nothing about the point of the exercises. I just hope they (or some of them) get a sense of truths beyond tech, beyond photographs and beyond words."
