        "text": " Once upon a time in the olden days,  the teacher stood out front and taught the whole class the same material in the same way. Everyone was expected to do the same tasks, some passed and some failed and were labelled ever after. The focus was on teaching, not on learning. One size was supposed to fit all and if you learned in a different way, too bad for you. Time passed and it turned out that everyone didn‚Äôt learn in the same way after all. The teacher realised that learners have different needs, interests and abilities. Differentiated instruction was invented. The teacher prepared different tasks for each group in her class and preparation now took a whole lot longer. The needs of the learner were being better catered for, but the teacher was up all night.  She needed to think about differentiation in a different way. 10 ways to differentiate learning‚Ä¶ 1. Let go.  Give the students (at least some) ownership of their learning. Don‚Äôt always be the boss of the class, be part of the community of learners. Don‚Äôt make all the decisions. Allow choice. Encourage students to think about how they learn best. Have students decide how to demonstrate their learning. 2. Change your expectations. One size does not fit all. Not everyone fits the traditional mould of school, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt learn. You might need to change what you do. Remember you teach people, not subjects. 3. Change the sequence.  Learners don‚Äôt need total mastery of all the skills before they can apply them. Provide meaningful, authentic learning opportunities for everyone. Turn Bloom‚Äôs taxonomy on its head. All students can solve real problems and write for a real audience. 4. Use technology creatively. Blogging, film making, global interactions, social media, photography, gaming (and much more!) ‚Ä¶all provide naturally differentiated opportunities for learners with varied levels of ability, different interests and special talents. 5. Care about what matters to them. Encourage learners to follow their interests. Know their story. Make their learning relevant. Connect with their passions‚Ä¶ or help them to discover what they might be. 6. Assess for learning. It‚Äôs not about a test at the end. Record student thinking and track development over time. Create meaningful assessment tasks that  allow transfer of learning to other contexts. Think of everything as an assessment. Every piece of work, every blog post, every interaction, every conversation can tell us where a learner is at and where they need to go. 7. Embrace inquiry as a stance.  Create a culture of thinking, questioning, wondering and exploring.  Start your questions with ‚ÄòWhat do you think?‚Äô so that all responses are acceptable. Find ways to provoke learners‚Äô curiosity and a desire to find out for themselves. 8. Don‚Äôt be the only teacher.  Students can learn from their peers, other teachers, parents, their on-line contacts, the world.  Help them build their own personal learning network with and from whom they can learn.  9.  Focus on learning, not work. Make sure you and your students know the reason for every learning experience. Don‚Äôt give ‚Äòbusy work‚Äô.  Don‚Äôt start by planning activities, start with the ‚Äòwhy‚Äò and then develop learning experiences which will support independent learning. 10.  Encourage goal setting and reflection. Help students to define goals for their learning. Provide opportunities for ongoing self-evaluation and reflection. Provide constructive, specific feedback.  Student blogs are great tools for reflecting on learning and responding to their peers. If you‚Äôre the teacher in the story above, take a look at this chart, highlighting the differences between differentiated instruction and personalised learning. Personalization vs Differentiation vs Individualization  by Barbara Bray."

In my work with teachers I find they need some modeling or coaching on how to do this well.  How to deconstruct and thenredesign a lesson to be more differentiated for the diverse group of learners.  I have seen Carol Ann Tomlinson on this topic a number of times and she provides the tools and framework for how to do it.  Your 10 tips give the push.  Diffentiating the assessment is equally as important as differentiating the instruction.  Thanks!"

I am researching more than ever to be ‚Äòup to speed‚Äô with my class. I‚Äôve really enjoyed learning from the students and benefited from peer to peer coaching. I read a paper by John Hattie today. He talked about a study led by Ian Wilkinson and says they are ‚Äòsurprised by the under utilisation of peers as co-teachers in classrooms, and the dominance of the adult in the room to the diminution of the power of the peer.‚Äô I feel encouraged that it is a good thing to use students to take leadership over the learning at times. We have just completed a study on Australian Government and after dividing the students into research groups they came back to the class to present their findings in ‚Äúexpert sessions.‚Äù The students reflected that these session were most helpful to their projects and it was a great opportunity for them to isten to another voice other than mine.The Hattie paper was found here:http://www.acer.edu.au/documents/RC2003_Hattie_TeachersMakeADifference.pdf"

I think, at least here in America, the education system is way to ‚Äútest centered‚Äù. The way the tests are handled is ridiculous.
