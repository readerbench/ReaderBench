Do teachers value compliance above learning? These are amongst the most common elements I found, none of which seem to relate to learning... Have our students’ training and experience set them up to believe that these are are the appropriate expectations for a learning environment? Some are even more extreme and less related to learning… Does this set the tone for engaging learning? Here are some of the more appealing inclusions I found, which are more likely to support an environment conducive to learning… and isn’t that the purpose of school? I really like this one! 10 ways to create a meaningful class agreement… What’s in your class agreement?"

Having class agreements can make a class extremely great. Class Agreements can make everyone act and think the same as their instructor. The ten ways you created Ms. Sackson are very essential for an educational process. You mentioned that you have to spend time before you establish your beliefs about learning. That was very critical to a person who takes their time before rushing to do their work."

But I seem to see too many teachers (maybe even myself!) giving lipservice to the idea of the agreement, the idea that the students are active participants in the construction of such agreements. When, in fact, we are creatively guiding our students to come up with the agreements that we want our class to have. It’s hard for us to let go of the control and guide students to make their descisions, not ours. I feel the same way about inquiry sometimes. Yes, inquiry is often structured and needs to be, but are we “pretending” to let inquiries be about what students are interested in, or are we just finding less-than-obvious ways to get them where we have already decided that they need to be? Both of these topics have been heavy on my mind as the school year begins where I am…"

You might start by pretending – it’s liberating when you are able to truly let go and let students take ownership of the learning (even within a framework of structured inquiry). Three great resources for you are the Inquire Within blog (range of perspectives on student directed learning) Just Wondering (Kath Murdoch, inquiry guru’s blog) and Inquiry as Stance on Curriculum, an article by Kathy short. Let me know if you need links!"

I’m MsKrisinBrazil on twitter and we’ve had a few interactions there as well, though I have been twitter-silent for several months. Reading your response to my response, I wonder if I misrepresented what I wanted to say. I’m a Girl Scout and in scouting we say, “Leader guides, girl decides”. This is nothing new for me. When I taught university students and preschoolers, my classes were always inquiry-driven. Jumping into inquiry in elementary school was not actually much of a jump for me. It can be like jumping into the deep end of the pool, because you never know what you are going to get. But I am concerned about the discourse I hear during faculty  meetings and around the water cooler. I include myself because I am part of that faculty and I need to be ever vigilant that I am NOT falling into those traps….and I regularly follow Inquire Within and Just Wondering. They are, in fact, great resources."

        "text": "I really like this article and found it to be reaffirming. Last year in grade one we worked on finding out what we need to do in school and what is learning?   Students enjoyed sharing what would be their dream classroom environment.  We let anything go and recorded all of their suggestions.  Like the second set of rules most of the exchanges from the students were what not to do.  As a teaching team we grouped the what not to’s into three simple headings, students helped with the sorting.  We came up with three essential agreements for the room that encompassed almost all of the suggestions, listen, take care, learn.  These three words were then used as questions, ‘Did you take care when you drew on Fred’s work?  Did you listen when Jane asked to play?, What did you learn here?’.  This year I will be on grade four and hope to use the same format in creating the essential agreements but hope to have stronger terms."

Using Glasser (Choice Theory) as a foundation along with 35+ years of teaching I have come up with “Please Be Child Friendly” as a mnemonic for PBCF. Here is the summary – much more on my blog along with a graphic. P is for “Power”, giving everyone a voice.  B is “Belonging”, knowing about your learners. C is for “Choice”, not free choice but offering choice and explaining consequences. F is for “Fun”, the challenge to teachers is to link this to achievement."
