        "text": " Guest post by Linda. @lindawollan After reading the post 10 Things A Teacher Should Know How To Do, by Andrew Garcia, my colleague Ed asked me what I would put on a list of tech skills for our teachers. What things would come first? At our school, many teachers can do none of the things on Andrew’s list. Some can do a few. Some wouldn’t know what most of the list means. It’s a great discussion to have. The successful use of tech tools comes down to a willingness to explore, either independently or at least what you’ve been shown.  You need to be willing to try new things, and willing to put in some time. The particulars depend on the needs of your class. If you are an active user of a class blog or wiki, then you need the  appropriate tools and should be motivated to learn them. At the very least, collaborate with your friendly tech support teacher to make sure your students don’t miss out! My list looks something like this: Of course as well as knowing about Web 2.0 tools, make sure the basics are in place. So before we even get to the list above: So- What’s on your list?  "

I have been thinking recently that I have been a bit ad-hoc in my approach to staff training in this area but I am happy to say I have covered nearly all the points you mention although I also acknowledge that I have tried to teach some of the first few without ensuring your second list is covered. Interestingly, tomorrow my techie brekkie is on delicious and diigo, as I recently became aware that many of my fellow teachers internet usage and bookmarking was a total mess. I am going to sit down with this list and check where I am personally at and where I am trying to take others too.thanks"
