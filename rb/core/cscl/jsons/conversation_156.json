        "text": " Once upon a time (in what seems like a faraway land, in another lifetime) students went to the computer room and the library for isolated weekly lessons. When we acquired laptops, the roles of Linda and Fiona, eLearning Facilitator and Librarian respectively, changed. They shifted to flexible timetables, going into classrooms, as required, to deliver specific lessons, team teach or support teachers and students with resources or tech trouble shooting. This year, every student in Year 4- 6 has their own iPad and itâ€™s clear that the traditional Librarian and eLearning Facilitator roles are shifting again. Resources are at the learnersâ€™ fingertips, devices are easy to use and apps are intuitive. Itâ€™s evident that iPads, by their very nature, promote inquiry learning. As Linda points out, thereâ€™s no need for the e in eLearning any more. And the once distinct roles of librarian and technology teacher have blurred, resulting in a dynamic partnership of overlapping skills and ideas. In this weekâ€™s meeting, I ask the Learning Team Leaders â€“ Whatâ€™s the most obvious way to eat these biscuits (cookies)?  With that out of the way, everyone writes down as many other ways as they can think of to eat them. Once weâ€™re past the obvious, the ideas get more creative and, the more time people have to think, the more unusual the ideas they come up with. I love this exercise, borrowed from Heidi Siwakâ€™s recent blog post. The group notes that- At this point I ask everyone to think creatively about Lindaâ€™s and Fionaâ€™s roles.Â  Initiatives already in place Once weâ€™re ready to spend some time looking beyond the obvious,Â a range of new ideas are generated. Suggestions Whatâ€™s next?Â  FionaÂ would like to collaborate with the Art and Music teachers on a unit of inquiry exploring multimodal texts and the way eBooks incorporate video and music. Lindaâ€™s next project is to meet with the new Year 4 and 5Â tech minions, see what needs they perceive and develop their program with them accordingly. Weâ€™ve only begun to look at new possibilities and weâ€™d love to hear about how these roles are developing and shifting at your schoolâ€¦ And, while weâ€™re thinking creatively, who else in the school has knowledge and skills that can be drawn upon in new, different and innovative ways?"

It always amazes me when someone takes an idea (in this case originated by Exhibit Change who are doing interesting work on Design Thinking and education) and further develops and extends it. This is one of the greatest gifts of the internet! We get to witness these shifts. What I found even more fascinating was the flexible attitude of your colleagues and their willingness to reinvent roles. Thanks for sharing this Edna."

        "text": "Hello EdnaI find the ideas of flexible timetable and flexible support roles appealing. I wish that my school could thrash this out and make a shift away from the-support-person-as-release-time-provider. This shift can only happen when we stop thinking of teaching as â€˜controllingâ€™ students, and when we stop thinking of learning as a set of cards we hold to our chest and donâ€™t share.The wall banner in our Year Two classroom states: â€˜There are 25 teachers in this classroom.â€™ My wonderful learners now have a habit of revising that number when any other person enters the room. Our College Principal was greeted with a shout â€™26 now!â€™ when she popped in last week.For me, the Education Assistants are invaluable. They are focused on individual learners, and if I value and seek out their thinking, they enhance my reflection.CheersBrette"

Connecting with students and checking their research is easier when the students work in Google Docs and use the @ in front of the email address of the person to whom they are commenting to, in the Comment feature.  I am a PYP librarian and my tech Action Plan this year has been to â€˜flipâ€™ the library by posting all Reading Programmes activity booklets and activity templates on the Junior School Library Online Catalogue webpage in order for students and parents to complete remotely and at anytime. http://catalogue.yorkschool.com I look forward to reading future posts.All the best,Sara"

I believe creativity is the most important tool out there! I was always taught to think in different ways and to find an unusual perspective on different circumstances throughout my life. Your post hit the nail on the head! I love the analogy about ways to eat Oreos-havenâ€™t we all been there? Whether youâ€™re four years of age, or 44 years of age, you never tire of finding new ways to eat those life-changing cookies. Your writing is so easy to read and so relatable, and I honestly enjoyed reading through about 5 of your other entries. You have a gift! Keep it up!"
