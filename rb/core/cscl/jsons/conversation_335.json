I know you think people should have a balanced life and not be online too much. I know you think a great deal of time is required to find resources and create connections. Last Sunday was a lovely, sunny day. Among other things, I went for a walk in the city, spent time with family, went out for breakfast with friends, cooked a pot of lentil soup, finished Seth Godin‚Äôs Poke the Box and read several chapters of A Man of Parts by David Lodge. I also spent 30 minutes on Twitter participating in #elemchat, where primary school teachers around the world¬†exchange¬†ideas and share their challenges. Here‚Äôs some of what I got out of that half hour: "

Sometimes on my phone while waiting to pick up my son from the train, or while on the sofa at night while semi watching tv. I refuse to view that as work or effort as I always get more from my dips than I put back in. In fact right now I am inspired to read, to comment and to learn while relaxing in the evening with my family. Why some other teachers cannot see this is something I still fail to understand. My teaching has improved so much in my time on Twitter, thus making my classroom and my life more fun, more engaging and more worthwhile."

Our teachers don‚Äôt use Twitter yet, but she set this up in advance of our session today!Quick advice: 1. Use Tweetdeck  2. Follow hashtags like #edchat and #elemchat and #edtech 3. Don‚Äôt even think of trying to keep up. You just dip in and out and and see what‚Äôs there at the time. 4. It takes quite a while to establish yourself.5. Talk directly to people in order to make it work eg say: @whatedsaid can you suggest some people i can follow?!If you have more questions, ask them right there on twitter, but add a hashtag like #edtech, then everyone can see it not just the people who follow you. Or add @lindawollan or @kathleeen_morris or @clivesir or @mgraffin‚Ä¶."
