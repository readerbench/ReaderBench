        "text": " Which do you think you focus on more in your classroom: work or learning?   Guy Claxton refers, in ‘What’s the Point of School?‘, to a study in which researcher Caroline Lodge discovered that teachers who professed to be interested in learning, used the word work 98% of the time and learning only 2%. How much of your class time is spent thinking and talking about the process of learning? Do you and your students talk, what Claxton calls, Learnish? Or is it all about getting the work done? It’s been exciting to hear so much Learnish being spoken as I wandered around my school this week. We chose to start the new school year inquiring into learning in every grade level. (Read about it here). Hopefully there will be carry over effects on learning for the rest of the year. Here’s a clip I made last year of kids talking about learning. Coming back to it now, one of the things I like most about it is the background noise. If people were trying to work, the noise would be disruptive. Sounds like learning!"

I have made a conscious shift this year (because of our unit on learning and what I learned about learning in preparing for the unit) to use the word learning and not work when talking to my students and to my team. My thinking is if we want kids to take ownership of their learning then we need to plan opportunities for learning to happen and make the learning visible for our students- all the time.I am so glad we started with this unit – am very excited for the learning journey ahead."

        "text": "Such a gret post, Edna!!Homework is sort of ritualized at my school. We have a specific day it is sent home and a specific day it needs to be returned. I do it because I am “supposed” to do it, but it is always a struggle for me. How can the “homework” kids take home be about ‘learning’ and not just be more ‘work’? Today students were shocked when their very first homework assignment of the year was to take home a leveled rader of their choice, read it at least 3 times, preferably with someone else, and be prepared to share during our community meeting on Tuesday. No paper. No worksheet. “Just read?” they asked. “Well, read, read again, think about what your reading, think about a good place to read and a good time to read. But, yes, just read.” It’s so far out of the norm for them. Sharing will not be retelling the story, but sharing how, when and with whom they read their book. Let’s see how it goes."

Teachers don’t realize the negative connotations associated with the word “work”. “Work” is a word used congruence with “chores” and other alike words, but “learning” seems so positive and uplifting. Great post! Keep them coming!"

I’m not a physicist or scientist but when talking about levers, isn’t work used to describe the transfer of energy from one mass to another?  Could we redefine work to reflect how we transfer our energy into the world around us? Monique"
