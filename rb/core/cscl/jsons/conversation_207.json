        "text": " Part of my role as Teaching and Learning Coordinator involves facilitating and supporting the planning of units of inquiry. Planning for inquiry can be difficult. On the one hand, over planning limits the potential for inquiry. On the other hand, we have desired outcomes and understandings, as well as the demands of a national curriculum. We used to plan a range of learning experiences in advance. You can read here about how we have improved our planning process. Nowadays, we start by identifying the desired conceptual understandings and carefully considering what evidence will indicate that our learners have achieved them. Then we plan some provocations that engage the learners in the big ideas and wait to see where the learning takes us.  Keeping an eye on the conceptual understandings allows us to add further targeted provocations as the inquiry unfolds. Creating a rubric helps clarify where our units are heading. Depending on the age of the learners, some teachers use the rubric with their students, others don’t, but either way, the process helps teachers focus on how to look for evidence of the understandings. Here’s an example for a Prep (5 year olds) inquiry into how family life has changed over time: "

The difference with ours is that there are four criteria as we find this adds a little extra thought by teachers and students and prevent the temptation just to highlight the middle one!!! However, we do sometimes get carried away and over complicate them, making them both less likely and more difficult to use. Your examples are wonderfully simple, easy for kids to use for self assessment and encapsulate the essence of the unit.I like the ones where the first box is really honest – “I don’t think about where energy comes from” – but then other first boxes are more of a positive step – “I can give examples”. Perhaps you need to move to four boxes and consistently make the first one that very honest statement as it really does help kids, then use the next three boxes for the progression of thinking."

Thanks for taking the time and effort to put your thinking out there.I too have experienced the impact that the cultural forces and visible thinking routines have on learning- both as a teacher and leader for learning.How do we assess understanding? How do we identify the types of learning that take place in our classrooms? We are engaged in the Looking for Learning process where we (other teachers/colleagues) go into classrooms and talk to students about their learning. Based on this evidence, follow up with learning conversations with the classroom teacher to make sense of the data to improve and increase learning, day by day, hour by hour. It has tremendous power to empower teachers and makes the paradigm shift from teaching to learning.  I think you would get it!!!annelies (learning labyrinth)"
