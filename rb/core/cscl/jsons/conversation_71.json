        "text": " Joining the cohort of teachers learning with @langwitches last week, when I could, I found them highly engaged and involved in their own learning. The approach was different from the last time Silvia visited our school. This time she worked with a group of teachers, each of whom¬†elected to participate, a diverse group with varying needs and different entry points.¬†This proved to be a¬†successful model of professional learning that aligns with our learning principles, a set of beliefs about learning that apply as much to teachers as to students. Despite (because of?) the diversity within the group, ¬†a high level of trust and collaboration were evident. Teachers had ownership of what and how they explored and Silvia stressed that this was about being self-directed, self-motivated learners. New skills were mastered within a context and there were opportunities to apply them purposefully and reflect on how they will be transferred.  The evidence is visible in more than a dozen personal blog posts on our collaborative blog, many by teachers who rarely write about their learning, most by teachers who have never blogged before, all sharing thoughtful documentation of, for and as earning. Take a look at a few examples‚Ä¶ Am I literate? by Lesley Help! I‚Äôm a digital citizen¬†by Limor Global literacy is a highway by Lauri I‚Äôm on my way‚Ä¶¬†by Nicole Sharing my learning leads to learning from and with others by Linda And some tweets that sum up the learning‚Ä¶  "
