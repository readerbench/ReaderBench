We share resources and ideas via Twitter. We meet at online conferences. We collaborate via Googledocs and wikis and Skype. It still seems like magic to meâ€¦ In just aÂ few tweets, five Â PYP educators, two in different parts of Australia, one in Hong Kong, one in Indonesia and one in Japan form a team without ever meeting. Within a couple of days we are exchanging ideas on a Googledoc and working collaboratively on a wiki. Connections are made. Learning is shared.Â Friendships are formed. A week or so later, we have created a buzz amongst other PYP educators around the world. #pypchat is born, a fortnightly live Twitter conversation, by IB PYPÂ Â educators, about issues related to teaching and learning. PYP is the Primary Years Program of the InternationalÂ Baccalaureate, but the chat is open to anyone whoâ€™s interested. The inaugural #pypchat has close to 50 participants from all over the globe.Â Itâ€™s early evening in Jakarta and Jay has his 4 year old with him. Hannah is kicking back on the couch after dinner in Melbourne. Tanja and Miranda in Accra have been given time out in the middle of the school day to participate. In Hong Kong, itâ€™s Jenâ€™s birthday and her family is waiting for a celebration dinner. Stephanie in Ohio and Alexandra inÂ SantiagoÂ are up in the early hours to join us before work. Craig has just left a staff meeting in Saigonâ€¦ Like all such Twitter chats, the conversation is fast and furious. It helps that as PYP educators, we have a common language.Â There is barely time to breathe as ideas are exchanged, beliefs are challenged and questions are raised. Sarah tweets from Hong Kong in the morning that her head is still buzzing. I canâ€™t wait to see how the chat is depicted by reflective illustrator, Mega in Batamâ€¦. "

Iâ€™m sad that teachers who feel they donâ€™t have enough time miss out on these opportunities. What they â€˜have to coverâ€™ sometimes gets in the way of fantastic learning opportunities. Thanks for sharing."

I love how these things just seem to grow a life of their own, spurred by the enthusiasm of a few and then joined and accelerated by other like minded colleagues.  A by-product of your chat amongst those already familiar with the IB PYP terms, was an increased awareness in those less familiar â€“ it had me browsing the websites and learning about Learner profiles etc.  Teachers taking control of their own learning, sharing their knowledge and questions, is a powerful thing.   Off to TeachMeet for a similar feeling â€¦. Celia"

Made me think that three years ago I had never heard of PLN and now I cant imagine not having one.  And made me think of how our Kindergarten children are using twitter, Google docs, Skype, blogs, VoiceThreads etc. Itâ€™s all my Kindergarten children know but it still feels like magic to me! Looking forward to the next piece of #pypchat magic!"
