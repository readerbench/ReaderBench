        "text": " I sent this email to the teachers at my school… Hi All In the past we have had successful voluntary learning groups in areas such as visible thinking, differentiated learning, global education and integrating technology. Teachers often feel that there are so many ‘things’, it is difficult to integrate everything. Some of us have talked before about ways to ‘connect the dots’. I think our learning principles can help pull things together. I’d like to start a new voluntary group, based on the Inquiry Circle I saw in New York during the holidays… in our own style. My vision of it looks like this: (Open, of course, to ideas, suggestions, modifications, negotiations!) Meet fortnightly for an hour before school and… Example questions for action research… #1 Question: How might we best arrange furniture and set up the classroom to promote learning? Area of interest: Learning space Learning principles: #2 Question: How can technology support differentiated learning opportunities? Area of interest: Integrating technology Learning principles: Simple Action Research model: Let me know if you’re interested in joining such an Inquiry Circle and we can take it from there… Edna I re-read the email before I sent it and had second thoughts…  Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Post Script: Six people are in! MY action research: Question: How can we create new models of professional learning in our school that help build our learning community, while embedding our learning principles in our practice? Area of interest: Teacher professional learning. Learning principles: All! Suggestions, tips and ideas invited!"

        "text": "Of course there is not just one model for action research! The very nature of action research is messy and conflicted. What happens when partway through you want to change the plan? Do you stick to the plan and preserve the rigor of the research or do you change the plan and support the learning in a better way? How do you deal with problems and glitches? The work with students must go on. The moment may be lost. How can that moment then be applied to your research. I love action research and count myself lucky to be in a school that supports my efforts. But how much would I love to have a WHOLE GROUP to share my work with on a regular basis. Good on you! This is a great initiative."

While I found it informative, I found the rigidity of the structure actually limited my experimentation and my You are modeling inquiry for your teachers while asking them to facilitate inquiry in the classroom. To me, this is a necessary pairing to help teachers become better at facilitating inquiry."
