Weâ€™ve been having similarÂ voluntary sessionsÂ for a couple of years, exploring web 2.0 tools, setting up class blogs, discovering alternative presentation tools, learning about copyright and the like. The group has grown to the point where almost every member of staff participates. We used to have: We wanted teachers to understand that: Â "

I am a K-5 technology facilitator going from scheduled weekly classes to flexible-scheduled classes. Your post describes exactly what we are looking to achieve this school year. We too have moved from desktop PCs to laptop carts and are now hoping to be using technology seamlessly throughout the day with my help."

        "text": "Hi Debra,I think the key to a flexible tech program for me is to plan with the teachers, so that I am really familiar with the units of inquiry at each level. This way, ICT is built into the studentsâ€™ learning in a meaningful way. Last year, when we had one lesson per week in the labs, I often found that at some times during the inquiry process we were scratching around to make ICT meaningful. At other times far more input than this was necessary. I now focus time where its needed, so perhaps working with students of one level a number of times a week, but not necessarily every week.It depends on the needs of their inquiry cycle, and where we have planned ICT to fit in. Although we do not have a 1:1 laptop program, we are well equipped with laptops, and students have good access. We are finding much ICT learning taking place on an â€˜as needsâ€™ basis. At times I work with individuals, at other times groups, whole classes or even whole levels. Edna and I have run sessions with the whole level at both Year 5 and Year 6, where students have been introduced to a number of tools, which they have explored for a whole afternoon. Students could then choose the tool that best suited their learning, and be supported along the journey.Another important factor in our program is my collaboration with other teachers. There has been steady improvement of classroom teacher ICT skills. It has been really gratifying that many teachers have voluntarily attended ICT professional development sessions, and are also able to support students in their ICT learning. Our library teacher also works on a flexible timetable, so sometimes we work with the students together, eg recently we co-taught about the issue of copyright. We are developing a program for our iPads together as well.It hasnâ€™t all been easy â€“ we are in a new building, with a new wireless network and new laptops. Often my time has been spent troubleshooting and liaising with our technical staff. However the flexible timetable allows me to work with both teachers and students in a way that is more meaningful than the once a week model. I hope it works for you too. Youâ€™re welcome to get in touch via Twitter â€“ Iâ€™m interested to hear about your plans and journey.Linda (@lindawollan)"
