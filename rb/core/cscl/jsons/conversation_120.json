        "text": " Our Teaching and Learning Team has an â€˜essential agreementâ€™, inspired by this clip: The Teaching and Learning Team agrees toâ€¦ â€¦ and encourage the above in everyone with whom we work. In a PYP school, every class, every team, even the whole school has an essential agreement which sets the tone for collaboration and teamwork. How else would we know what the shared norms and expectations are? There are endless ways to develop such agreements and, since itâ€™s the start of a new school year in Australia, all our teams and classes have been working on theirs. It didnâ€™t take long for our Teaching and Learning Team â€“ Director of Teaching and Learning (Literacy) , Early Years Learning Coordinator, Head of Learning Support, Teaching Coach, Maths Coordinator and me â€“ to come up with ours, since we already have common passions and aÂ shared vision. We watched the Piano Stairs clip, noted and shared how it relates to our roles and goals and.. voila! All we had to do was compile them into a list and we are ready to take on the new school yearâ€¦ and the world ðŸ™‚ Â  Â "
