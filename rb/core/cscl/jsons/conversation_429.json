What you miss will be recorded so you can even learn in your own time. The Reform Symposium, from 30th July-1st August, is a free online conference, showcasing innovation in education. It’s for educators, administrators, parents and students and will focus on the role of innovative practice in educational reform. The presenters are absolutely inspirational educators!  I’m proud to say that many are part of my online learning network, I read their blogs and interact with them on Twitter,  and I can’t wait to hear them ‘in person’.  Organised by the inimitable Kelly Tenkely and  Shelly Terrell (who never sleep!) along with Jason Bedell, and Chris Rogers , this is an opportunity not to be missed. For more background and information on how to participate, see Kelly’s blog ilearntechnology and the Reform Symposium.  "
