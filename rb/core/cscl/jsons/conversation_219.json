He mentions reading some of my blog posts and Iâ€™m suddenly aware that I rarely write about technology any more. When I started this blog, I had a tag for tech, a tag for web 2.0 tools and a tag for 21st century learning. Now itâ€™s a givenâ€¦. Scenario 1: Year 6 learners connect with classes in Japan, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Thailand and Singapore for their inquiry into inter-connectedness. Read:Â Skype with Japan.Â Â Skype with Australia.

If not, great as well.A very similar approach could be taken towards â€˜digital literacyâ€™.  In todayâ€™s day and age, is this not just literacy?"
