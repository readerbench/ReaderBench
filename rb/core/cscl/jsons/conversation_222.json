I’ve written before about communities of practice, about teachers owning their learning and about other forms of effective professional learning. Now, as we consider professional learning in the coming school year, staff will be asked to respond to a survey which will guide our planning. Here’s a slightly adapted version of the staff survey. It would be valuable and exciting to gather responses from teachers all over the world! Please respond and share…  "

Perhaps staff might also this as a model for the same kind of thing being done with students in relation to THEIR learning for the year ahead? It would be powerful to have both kinds of surveys going on at the same time! Looking forward to hearing how this informs your work. Thanks for sharing"

I was reading your blog today and I think that you are on a great track for improvement. Teachers need to come together and explain what works for them and what does not. This will not only help future teachers, such as myself, but it will also make sure other teachers do what works best for the students. I do think  that suggestions are wonderful. It brings new ideas to the table and it helps with road-blocks in education. Have you ever thought about integrating more project time into the classroom? I learned about something new, and it was about flipping the classroom. It is a wonderful way to take the lecturing out of the classroom and bring the projects in. The lesson would be taught at home through podcasts and students would have more time to have discussions and group time. This would be great because they would be more engaged in what they are learning. Courtney Block"

Too often we have PD days where we are constantly bringing in new ideas and approaches but never have a chance to then follow up and make it our own through continued exploration or creation based on these ideas.  Your sampling of how teachers chose to spend their time was inspirational and I know my teachers would love such an opportunity.  Thanks again.  I am revitalized this Monday morning!"
