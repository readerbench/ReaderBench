        "text": " At the start of 2013, I‚Äôll be reducing my role as Teaching and Learning Coordinator at my school and looking for new challenges. Since I will no longer be employed full-time, I‚Äôll have time to share my educational knowledge and experience, in person or virtually, and I‚Äôm excited by the possibilities. I‚Äôd love to facilitate workshops for teachers (or students, or student teachers) in inquiry learning, creating a culture of thinking, 21st century skills, concept-driven learning, educational leadership, global connectedness, promoting creativity‚Ä¶. or anything else I have written about on this blog that appeals to you. I‚Äôd be happy to help you develop a vision for implementing technology, work with teachers to promote student centred learning, assist in building a community of practice, or help your school articulate your learning principles. You can contact me at whatedsaidideas@gmail.com. Please do not send me sales emails of any kind. Guest bloggers post here at my invitation only.¬†If you have other ideas, offers, collaborations or workshop requests, please email me!"

Not everyone is this!I want to encourage you to take up at least one of the ‚Äúam not great at‚Äù fields. And, explore it at leisure. I am sure you have done enough teaching and guiding to know that you might well surprise yourself at how naturally you seem to absorb these old subjects from a new viewpoint.Looking forward to interacting more with you! And Good luck!"
