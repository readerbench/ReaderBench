        "text": " Flying for many hours means I have had plenty of time to catch up on reading saved blog posts. I think I‚Äôve learned more from reading (and writing) educational blogs than I have from any other professional learning during the many years that I have been in education.  Some of my favorite posts contain examples of great practice, thoughtfully written, that make you wish you were there. I enjoy open, honest posts about dilemmas and failures and what was learned from each experience. I like posts written in the writer‚Äôs authentic voice, without self promotion or pretentious language.  How can I encourage those teachers at my school, who haven‚Äôt yet opened this book, to read (and maybe write!) blogs regularly, to see what teachers are doing globally, further their awareness of what‚Äôs possible, engage with new ideas and see their existing beliefs validated, questioned, or shared by teachers around the world? Here‚Äôs my plan for a series of short, supported sessions for those teachers in the new year.  Let me know what you think‚Ä¶ 10 steps to get teachers into blogs‚Ä¶ 1. Read.Start by sharing a print-out of a powerful blog post.  2. Discuss.Print off a number of posts on a similar topic. Discuss the different perspectives. 3. Connect.Bring your device.  Each one gets a link to a different blog. Read and share highlights. 4. Navigate.Find your way around  blogs. Follow links. Go to other places.. 5. Subscribe.Set up a reader with recommended blogs. Learn how to subscribe to feeds. 6. Communicate.Talk about something interesting you discovered via your reader. Share a newly discovered blog. 7. Participate.Join the blogging conversation. Start by writing a combined comment. Choose a post and write your own comment. 8. Collaborate.Work together on a collaborative post for our teacher-blog (to date most posts have been written by me, and not widely read!) 9. Create.Each teacher creates a post sharing an idea from a blog they read, how it influenced their thinking, or a picture of practice from their class. 10. Reflect.I used to think‚Ä¶ Now I think‚Ä¶ Might it work? Am I missing anything?"

Usually makes my morning here in Brooklyn. üôÇSeems to me this approach will work well and I look forward to seeing how it plays out for you. Much to learn.I was particularly struck with steps one and two as it is consistent with the idea that Notice. Engage. Mull. Exchange is helpful way to think about the process of learning. By printing out a post and sharing it at the same time with a teacher it creates the experience of Noticing Together.  My strong hunch is that the very act of all having the physical presence of the post at the same time will lead to a significantly different experience from suggesting, asking, cajoling teachers to go on the web and read a post and then discuss.From what I understand it is consistent with the insights of Visible Thinking as well as my own experience in the difference between engaging with the screen vs engaging with Print , where ideas sit still."

My recommendations come from the fact that I have contemplated starting a blog during the past year, but a couple of things keep stopping me.  If you could address these, I think you would be on the road to success:1.  As you share sample blogs, be sure teachers see that not every blog entry is earth-shattering, make-you-jump-up-and-shout stuff.  I think my struggle with starting is that I feel like what I have to say can NOT be that interesting or important.  2.  I think this is what you intend in your steps 9 and 10‚Äì be sure to set aside some time when teachers can actually set up their blogs and begin their first posts.  I think I would be much more likely to start if I was sitting next to someone who was working on it at the same time, and who I could bounce ideas off of.You inspire me with your blog‚Ä¶maybe I‚Äôll get started in 2012~!"

Well after reading this blog i can understand that it would be really useful to have a blog and to read other teachers blogs.

Sitting down and sharing my blog posts with teachers would be an amazing way to reach out to them. I think it is a way of lending a helping hand to first time teachers.
