        "text": " With whom do you learn? Do you collaborate with a group of teachers at your grade level? Do you share and bounce ideas with others in your school, your building, your area? Do you belong to a network of teachers who meet to exchange ideas and share practice? Do you participate in voluntary¬†reading and learning groups? Have you been to informal ‚Äòteachmeets‚Äô organised by teachers for teachers? Have you participated ¬†in global online conferences? Do you write your own blog to share your ideas, reflections and practice with other educators? Do you participate in the global education conversation by reading and¬†commenting¬†on educational blogs? Do you engage with other educators on Twitter? A session with teachers yesterday on developing our class blogs, ¬†highlighted ways we can learn together. I was reminded of one of the most powerful influences in the building of my online ¬†PLN.  It was Kelly Tenkely‚Äòs blogging alliance that first connected me with many other educational bloggers around the world. It seems to me that connecting our students via Quadblogging can have similar effects. It‚Äôs much more than what David describes on the website as ‚Äòa leg up to an audience for your class/school blog‚Äô, ¬†although that‚Äôs an important starting point. Writing for an authentic audience, receiving¬†feedback from the world, reading what others write and responding to them are all undoubtedly valuable outcomes. But it‚Äôs more than that. With whom do your students learn? Are they expected to spend a whole year engaging with the same group of ¬†twenty or thirty students in your classroom? There are so many ways we can help our students create their own¬†personal learning networks. Quadblogging is another way to extend¬†the potential for learning beyond the classroom walls‚Ä¶"

A couple of months ago, we switched to one blog, two administrators.  So, so, so much better! I want to get into Quadblogging next year.  It is on my ‚Äòto do‚Äô list! I would love to do another administrator in another school too.  So much to do!  Love, love, love it!"

        "text": "Yes, I think we made a mistake by insisting each teacher at a grade level have their own class blog. The rationale was that we wanted everyone on-board, experimenting, playing with possibilities, learning how to use the blogs. We thought if they shared blogs, one teacher would end up taking control and those less comfortable with technology wouldjust  sit back. In trying to ensure ownership by all teachers, we sacrificed an opportunity for students to connect naturally across the grades. Not too late!!PS Our principal still insists on class newsletters as well‚Ä¶"

This process is a positive reinforcement to learning by thinking outside of the box.  The different avenues that can be taken from integrating technology in the classroom are limitless.  Most important would be his/her ability to interact with other schools and institutions as a ‚Äúguided road‚Äù if you will into the real world and adulthood."

Connecting around the globe is a great way to learn and share and great for those schools not equipped yet with the skills or tools for video conferencing.  I have a goal that at least every school in our network will have one excited teacher join quadblog network.  Thanks for the sharing, it is the highlight of many mornings."
