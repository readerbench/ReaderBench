        "text": " What would happen if we didn’t have numbers? Rubi poses this question to her Year 5 class, as a provocation,  generating wonderful ideas and discussion…  One student declares ‘We wouldn’t have time’ to which another responds ‘There would still be time, just no way to record it’…and they are on their way to a deeper conceptual understanding. As Rubi shares the conversation with me, we are excited, not just by the kinds of things the children have thought about, but by the power of a simple open-ended question to  provoke thinking and inspire discussion. She tells me she had planned to give a Maths pre-test during that lesson but, swept along by the comments, questions and conversation, had forgotten all about it. I point out that everything is an assessment. She agrees that she has gathered a broad range of data via this discussion, not just in terms of their understanding of the content, but about her students as learners. She can tell: Our school goal for the year is to use data to inform teaching and improve learning. While many think of data as the formal, numerical kind, it’s interesting how much informal data can be gleaned from careful observation and really listening to the learning. This is how good inquiry teachers decide where to go next. Plan in response to learning, not in advance…"

Which makes me wonder which they’re more afraid of: trusting teachers’ anecdotal data, or simply letting go of the comfort of statistics?"

Some students started to problem solve e.g. How might we tell the time of day (as accurately as possible) without numbers? Inquiry at its best – when students choose to challenge themselves ‘off their own bat.’ Students grouped themselves – great to see a range of ability groups collaborating with such excitement."

This sticky note activity is like having a group discussion, but instead of having to come up with a response immediately, a student can have  more time to process their reply. I love that the administrator of the activity can see watch the students communicate their well thought over ideas without having to pressure any of them to reply since they take initiative themselves. In this way the teacher can also watch the development of individual thinking and assist kids who might need more help."
