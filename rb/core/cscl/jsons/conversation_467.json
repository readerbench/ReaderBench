        "text": " I have blogged recently about creating a culture of thinking and about introducing thinking routines as a structure to promote and develop students‚Äô thinking. Another of Project Zero‚Äôs thinking routines is ‚ÄòI used to think‚Ä¶ Now I think‚Äò. ¬† Using this routine, students reflect on their understanding of a topic or issue and explore how and why that thinking has changed. ¬†It provides a structure for students to identify and think about new learning, opinions and understandings. Here‚Äôs my version of ¬†‚ÄòI used to think, now I think‚Ä¶‚Äô ¬†It‚Äôs by no means a comprehensive list, just a sample! ¬†Please add your thoughts in the comments‚Ä¶ üôÇ I used to think it was about the¬†teaching. Now I think it‚Äôs all about the learning. I used to think every student had to put up his hand before he spoke and all conversation had to go through me. Now I think, the best discussions are ones where the kids are responding to each other and I‚Äôm out of the picture. I used to think that praising kids was necessary positive reinforcement. Now I think that feedback needs to be constructive and specific and praise on its own isn‚Äôt helpful. I used to think silence had to be filled by repeating the question or asking a different question. Now I think silence means every student is having enough time to think. I used to think differentiation meant setting different tasks for different abilities. Now I think digital tools often ¬†provide natural differentiation for different levels and abilities. I used to think exercise books had to be neat, with a margin drawn at the side. Now I think exercise books are for thinking, reflecting, scribbling ideas and working things out, so it doesn‚Äôt matter what they look like. I used to think finished work should be hung on the wall so the class could see it. Now I think the best place for samples of learning is on the class wiki where an authentic audience can read/listen and comment. I used to think my students learned best sitting facing the front of the classroom. Now I think they need to sit in groups, in order to collaborate. I used to think the classroom needed to be quiet and I needed to be in control. Now I think noisy lessons where the kids are engaged often reflect learning at its most vibrant. "

Some of the things you have mentioned are things I have been working on this year with my students, particularly the conversation bit. I noticed that my students were unable to have conversations without interrupting each other or getting angry with each other unless I was there to enforce the hands-up routine. That‚Äôs not realistic is it? Life just isn‚Äôt like that. There‚Äôs a lot of things we do as teachers that create problems for kids in the long-term!!!Sam"

The secret sauce is creating a non threatening way to say ‚ÄúI was wrong.‚Äù  The risk to reputation of being wrong is at the heart of what slows down the learning process. In the principal‚Äôs offce, the school board‚Äôs office, at teacher meetings and conferences and in the classroom it‚Äôs all the same mechanism.Imagine if a politican, school board member etc etc could say ‚Äù I used to think, now I think.‚ÄùMy contribution: I used to think I knew everything and could change the world.Now I think I know alot about very little and the world changes all by itself."
