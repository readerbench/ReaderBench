        "text": " What if Ron Ritchhart’s  cultural forces were applied  to the concept of leadership? How might a leader, in any context, ensure that he or she provides time, sets expectations, engages in interactions, uses language, models actions, creates an environment and ensures opportunities that empower the community to flourish?  As a leader, irrespective of your context, what kind of culture do you create? 1. Expectations Do you convey clear expectations and ensure shared understanding? 2. Modeling Do you model the attitudes and dispositions you hope to see in others? 3. Time Is there adequate time for in-depth exploration, planning, collaboration and reflection? 4. Interactions Do you build positive relationships, respect the contributions of others and value diverse perspectives? 5. Routines Are processes in place for  identifying problems, exploring solutions, reflecting and giving feedback? 6. Language Does your language reflect shared beliefs, demonstrate support, reveal vulnerability and invite constructive questioning? 7. Opportunities Do you encourage learning and growth, experimentation and innovation? Are there opportunities for new leaders to develop? 8. Environment Does the physical, emotional and cultural environment facilitate autonomy, mastery and purpose. (Dan Pink)"
