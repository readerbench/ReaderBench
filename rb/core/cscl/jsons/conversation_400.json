        "text": " Imagine a middle-aged teacher in Australia singing a song together with a group of bubbly kids in an urban slum in Hyderabad, India! If youâ€™ve been reading this blog a while, youâ€™ll know about the SOLE (SelfÂ organisedÂ learning environment) project and youâ€™ll have read about some of my interactions on Skype with kids in India. There were no sessions for a while due to reasons which remain a mystery to us. Often the cloud mediators will wait online in the hope of an interaction, never knowing whether the reason for a no-show is a holiday or exam time or thereâ€™s no internet connection. But theyâ€™re back! It never ceases to amaze me how much fun I can have with a group of kids so very different from the eleven year olds I teach here in Melbourne. Most of them have very limited English. Yesterdayâ€™s was a delightfully enthusiastic group of chattering girls, who are regulars at the SOLE, a room with computers, next to their school. This was our second interaction and they were excited to chat with me again. As usual, they vied for the â€˜front seatsâ€™ at the computer. Neha took control, probably because herÂ EnglishÂ is a little better than the others. There were also Thaseen, Atiya, Â Zakiya, Jabeen and a few others who came and wentÂ in the background. They speak little English and their background couldnâ€™t be more different from mine, but we connect as human beings and I love that. We laughed a lot. We made faces. We sang together.Â I showed them how to fold an origami dog. Iâ€™m not sure whether they knew it was supposed to be a dog, but they loved it anyway and it kept reappearing in front of the camera as we chatted. They told me they learn Urdu at school, so I asked to hear what it sounded like and they spontaneously recited a poem in chorus! They also sang a song in Hindi, but the highlight was the English song we could sing together. They finished each presentation with a theatrical series of thank yous. I clapped, they clapped, we laughed some more. They taught me to say thank you in Urdu (shukria) and in Hindi (dhaniyavath). Every experience I have influences who I am as a teacher. I know I learn as much from these sessions as the kids do.Â So I find myself imagining such interactions between my own students and these children. I wonder what learning they would take awayâ€¦ Â A small attempt last month was very successful. Letâ€™s hope we can get around the time difference and make further connections possible."

I so often think, what ifâ€¦â€¦Two days ago I was in Ho Chi Min City, Vietman (where I used your â€™10 thingsâ€™ articles as a resource, very useful, you will have more followers now I am certain) and on my way home later in the evening a girl of 8 or 9 yrs old came up to me to sell gum. Such a vibrant little girl with near perfect english. I bought two packs of gum, then gave the gum back to her so she could sell it again. She said she attended a school near by but had to sell gum (at 10pm on a school night) to pay for her school fees. What ifâ€¦â€¦."
