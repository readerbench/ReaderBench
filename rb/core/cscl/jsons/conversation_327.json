I love your blog also and am so inspired by what you do ‚Äì and that you have the time to share so much with your blogging community.I have an education consultancy and train teachers to improve their literacy and special education teaching skills.  I work with teachers from ‚Äúpreviously disadvantaged‚Äù (don‚Äôt you just love the SA euphemism?) schools and often visit their classrooms and give support where I can.It would be terrific to have more contact!  I‚Äôm also very interested in your Indian connections.  I‚Äôm in love with India (been 4 times and have visited a few schools ‚Äì very briefly) and would really like to spend time teaching there as I think there are many similarities between SA and India.Come back for a visit‚Ä¶ you won‚Äôt be sorry!Judi üôÇ"
