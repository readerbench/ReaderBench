        "text": " My school’s focus this year, more than ever, is on student ownership and many teachers have set themselves the goal of increasingly letting go.  It’s been six years since I wrote 10 ways to encourage students to take responsibility for their learning and it’s still the post with the most hits on this blog, on a daily basis.   Looking back at this surprisingly popular post about student ownership, I realise that most of the tips identified are the behaviours that effective modern leaders exhibit, leaders who wish to encourage autonomy and to shift from a hierarchical model of leadership to a distributed one.  And once again I note that what works with kids, works as much with adults! What kind of leader are you? Ask yourself these questions… (not just if you’re a manager.) 1. Who makes the decisions? How often do you ask your teachers, parents and students what they think? How do you ensure shared ownership of decision making? Do you work collaboratively to define problems and develop solutions? 2. Are you open to other perspectives? Do you come with preconceived ideas, ask others’ opinions, then do what you wanted to do anyway? Or are you open to the ideas and perspectives of others, especially if supported by knowledge, experience and evidence? 3. Do you listen more than you talk? Do you really listen to the people above, below and beside you? Do you listen to the changing world around you…?  4. Do you model behaviors and attitudes that promote learning? Do you talk about your own learning? Are you an inquirer? Are you an active participant in the learning community? Do you model and encourage enthusiasm, open-mindedness, curiosity and reflection? 5. Do you take an inquiry stance? You don’t need to be the expert. Do you explore, experiment, reflect, learn from failures, try again… collaboratively?  6.  How do you get your people involved? How do you ‘invite participants in’ and get them excited to explore an issue further? Do you plan every detail or do you leave space for your people to make their mark? 7.  Do you value initiative above compliance? Do your teachers know the reason for everything you ask them do? Do you implement one-size-fits-all rules that ensure compliance? Or do you encourage your people to use common sense and rely on professional judgment? Do you celebrate initiative? 8.  Do you focus on growth rather than accountability? What kind of performance reviews do your teachers have? Are they evaluated against a list of preset criteria? Or do they have opportunities to set their own goals and have support and encouragement to grow? 9. Do you encourage reflection and seek feedback? Do you get your teachers and leaders to reflect on experiences and initiatives and think about how they might be improved? Can you take notice of what they say and plan ahead based on their feedback? 10.  Do you display an innovator’s mindset? Do you constantly look at things through fresh lenses? Do you ask yourself, and those around you, what you could change and how you could improve things? Are you willing to seek solutions that lie beyond the known, in the realm of emergent practice? And remember… You can lead from anywhere."
