As they gathered their belongings to go back to their classes, I heard their comments:‘I got so much out of that’, ‘All my questions were answered’, ‘I didn’t even know there were PYP schools all over the world’, ‘The kids were sooo cute’, ‘You learn so much more this way, than from just looking stuff up’….  What’s the other story? (Craig) As with many students attending international schools, our students come from upper middle class to upper class homes. The students see what they have and their lives as being ‘normal’. It is quite common for families at our school to have housekeepers, nannies, drivers, security guards and the like. Other children come to school on the back of a motorbike, which is the most common form of transport used in Vietnam. To prepare for the session with the Year 6 students in Australia, my students were asked to think about the questions over the weekend so we could brainstorm and share ideas prior to the Skype conference. I was quite pleasantly surprised by the thought the students had put in and some of the contributions that they’d made. My students reminded me of the mosquito borne virus, Dengue Fever, which has affected the families of at least 7 of my students, including my wife. They also came up with the flooding that we deal with on a monthly basis due to king high tides on the Saigon River. I wish I was that switched on to the world around me when I was 9 years old. While my students recently completed and video recorded many personal interviews as part of  their current unit of inquiry, the Skype conference with Year 6  students from Edna’s school has given me the inspiration to try something similar when we’re inquiring into cultures and religions. I have former colleagues teaching all over the world who might be willing to support my students as they continue accessing primary sources. Instead of reading books about religions in February,  the students inquiring into Judaism can Skype with students at Edna’s school, those inquiring into Islam can talk with students from my former school in the Middle East. I think by the time the conference had come to an end, everyone had taken away something positive – what could be better than that?"

What a great way to finish this post – authentic learning between people from different contexts about their own lives – who else is better to  share information than those people who live it daily?! Just as one of your students said Edna…thanks for sharing this story 😀"

I really enjoyed reading your post about the meaning of being a global citizen.  I love how your students had the opportunity to connect and talk with a school in Vietnam.  I wish I could have had this chance when I was in middle school.  Also, your idea about chatting with different schools about their different religions sounds like a great idea.  Your students could immerse themselves and learn more than they ever could from reading a book.  I wish you all luck and I hope you have a great week!Charlie"

Some companies have software for an online classroom and a full curriculum that students in both countries share!  It is kind of like Facebook for an exlusive group of students.  Pretty cool stuff.  We got to work with a class in China.  No live video because of the time difference, but we got to talk with the students there using comments, recorded video, blog, pictures…  I don’t know who makes it, but we call it nimbus.  I wish we got to skype live though!"
