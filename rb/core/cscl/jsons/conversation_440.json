        "text": " Des is a teacher who has actively resisted technology for quite a while! Her son is an ICT expert and she has always relied on him to do things for her.  She tried… but she made excuses, she apologised, she labeled herself.  She would come to our tech sessions, write copious notes, express interest in having a go, but never feel comfortable. We’re talking about a wonderful, passionate teacher, willing to embrace change… just not technology. June 2010:  In the past few weeks, there’s been a shift for her.  She had a go at one thing and then another…And now it seems as if she’s crossed some invisible line and anything is possible!  She has given her Year 4 students a choice as to which web 2.0  tools to use to express their learning and allowed them to guide her.  Her class has collaborated with a class in the UK on a Voicethread, sharing information and learning.  She’s seen the potential of  Skype in the classroom, and after being talked into one supported session, is now setting up her next one herself…. She attributes the change to the following: Perhaps these factors can help other teachers move forward in integrating tech into their teaching and learning. At a conference I attended recently, presenter Stephen Knowles put it like this, ” Technology shouldn’t drive, it should empower…”  What do you think, Des?

I have watched the transformation in Des too, and then see it grows like ripples in her team.As always, how we use the tools depends on the thoughtfulness of the teacher. We can really communicate across the world   if we understand what we want to achieve from  these conversations .Our  responsibilityis  to make sure the questions we ask and the conversations we have are thoughtfully articulated and explored in depth with  our students.I guess I am even more aware now of audience and purpose.Communication means more  responsibility and senstivity… a new layer needed  to think about."
