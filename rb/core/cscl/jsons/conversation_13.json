        "text": " Our early years teachers call it ‘ping pong’. What invitation or provocation do we throw to the children?  How do they respond?  How do we decide where to go next, based on what’s been revealed? Whilst early years teachers are skilled at documenting learning, and at making decisions about what to catch and what to throw back to the children, teachers of older learners traditionally plan further in advance, paying more attention to addressing curriculum outcomes than to where children might lead the learning. Drawing on our work with Sam Sherratt a few years ago, we have been working on a more responsive approach to planning, even in the upper grades. In our Learning Team Leaders meeting, teachers reflected on the ways that ongoing collaborative planning meetings in their teams have changed over time… When I posted the ‘what’s been revealed‘ slide on Twitter recently, it was viewed with appreciation by educators around the world and I enjoyed seeing the idea loop back to @sherrattsam. In another loop, I found our Early Years Leader, @shanupiter’s ‘ping pong’ referred to in an old post by Sam and I was reminded of a clip I made some years ago illustrating where my ideas come from. I’m intrigued by the notion of the biography of an idea, recently brought back from a Cultures of Thinking conference by our Year 6 teachers, as we explore possibilities for further opening up our PYP expedition. Over the years we have simplified PYPX, shifting the focus from product to process, from a fact finding mission to the development of self as a learner... What else? It’s a ‘ping pong’ provocation. By Monday, the team will have picked up the ball and be ready to throw something back! Within a few days, the idea will either have rolled into the gutter, or my entire network will help develop it further by responding with elaborations and further ‘what if’s. I know that much about the biography of an idea!"

The argumentative aspect of it was most interesting. After an animated discussion, about half of my class had a mind shift."
