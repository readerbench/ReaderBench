It‚Äôll be the first time in nearly 30 years that I don‚Äôt have a class to teach and it‚Äôs not an easy adjustment! For as long as I can remember, I have started the year by planning the first day for my new classes. Reflecting on all those new beginnings, I realise how much teaching and learning have changed‚Ä¶ and how much¬†I¬†have changed. What needs to happen on ‚ÄòDay 1‚Äô ? I used to think‚Ä¶ Now I think‚Ä¶ 10 ways to create a learning culture‚Ä¶ Two years later, I still like that list.¬†I work more with teachers than with children, these days, ¬†and I notice that the points apply just as much to starting a new year of professional learning with teachers. So here‚Äôs the list again, with suitably relevant (different!) links‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ and a more relevant title!"

In the U.S. we are in the middle of the school year and are beginning to think through how we want to end the school year and frame our focus for the return in the fall.  Your insight has given me some things to reflect on personally and professionally and is creating a mental explosion of thoughts, ideas, and ‚Äòwhat ifs‚Äô that is energizing!As a new teaching and learning coach, I need to model for my colleagues my belief that learning comes from within when the learner is engaged and involved in the experience.  I need their professional development experiences to mirror the types of experiences that our students need in (and out) of the classroom.  With this post, I feel like I now have some specific topics for discussion and ways to encourage collaboration to achieve this goal.  Thank you!"

This is my first education class so I am very eager to learn anything and everything I can from other educators to prepare me for my career in education. I plan to teach kindergarten or first grade because I love little children and their creativity and eagerness to learn when they first go to school. I really enjoyed reading your blog and how you compared the lists of the things ‚ÄúI Used to Think‚Äù and ‚ÄúNow I think‚Äù after your 30 years of experience. I especially like the idea of seating children in groups that promote and encourage collaboration among students. I believe we can sometimes understand and learn better from our peers than our teacher sometimes because it is less intimidating and we are not scared to make the wrong choice and be original. I also think it is really important to ‚Äúknow everyone‚Äôs story‚Äù. Sometimes we do not understand why or how some children progress and understand faster than others, but we do know that where they come from and what affects their environment can have on their ability to learn. Thanks so much for sharing this information. I look forward to reading more of your posts and using them in my class room one day.Thanks, Jamie Lynn Barbourhttp://barbourjamieedm310.blogspot.com/jamielynnbarbour@gmail.com"

I did a great collaborative activity the other day ‚Äì and just realized we then moved on without me asking the kids to share what we learned. Which means I gave them the old method of having a chance to practice but did not demonstrate that I valued their thinking by listening to what they found. I jsut might begin today‚Äôs class by asking them to share that!  Thanks for another great post!"
