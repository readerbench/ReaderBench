        "text": " As I said before‚Ä¶ Learning for teachers isn‚Äôt limited by the walls any more. We can share ideas, discuss our practice, learn with and from other educators outside our own institutions. Skype allows us to collaborate with anyone, anywhere, (almost) any time. On a cold,¬†wintry¬†morning, twenty educators rose early for an a voluntary professional learning session before school hours. Kathleen and Kelly are a couple of vivacious and energetic, young teachers at a school a couple of hours away from ours. They were in their classroom early, supported by their principal Ruth, to share their experience and advice with us via Skype. At my school, teachers gathered in the library to further their own learning about class blogging to promote literacy. Many of our teachers started class blogs this year for the first time. A few were blogging with their classes last year. None are bloggers themselves. Kathleen and Kelly talked us though their class blog and explained how it is an integral part of teaching and learning literacy. They answered questions about how to encourage students to blog and parents to comment. We saw a delightful video of students talking about the benefits of blogging. We were shown evidence of students‚Äô progress in writing, through the development of their comments on the blog.¬†Teachers left the session inspired to move their own class blogs forward, armed with new ideas and examples. As always, here‚Äôs what I learned: "

You are also a connector: I loved Kathleen‚Äôs blog and subscribed.What you say about hearing it from the outside is so true. Hearing the voices from the inside after a while sounds like droning. So‚Ä¶..I know that I owe you a post, but I just had a flash of an idea. Would you like to do some teacher training via Skype to a MEXTESOL local event, July 2nd (lovely Saturday) to EFL teachers in Morelia?Just asking, Ellen"

What‚Äôs the worst that can happen?‚Äù Has been a sounding board for the past year, and I‚Äôm certain my colleagues are getting tired of me pleading for them to innovate regardless of circumstance.
