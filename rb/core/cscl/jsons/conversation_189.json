It might help to spend some time thinking about how the seemingly disparate parts are connected…’ Those were the opening lines to a post I once wrote entitled ‘Connecting the dots.‘ Unfortunately I didn’t get beyond identifying the problem, which resulted in some great conversation… and more questions than answers. The truth is, I didn’t really know how to help teachers connect the dots. Two years down the track, I have a slightly better idea and it’s something I’m constantly working on. Enter Time Space Education. As mentioned in my previous post, our teachers didn’t want or need ‘another new thing’ and our brief to Sam and Chad was to ‘pull the pieces together’. Amazingly, they did. And, without really introducing ‘another new thing’, their approach pulled things together in a way that was both new and fresh! As stated on their blog, these are the basic principles behind their practice, all of which contribute towards ‘pulling the pieces together,’ creating powerful learning experiences and reducing the stresses induced by the demands of teaching… I’ve linked to some posts on their blog (and a couple on others!) elaborating on some of these principles. The sessions Sam and Chad ran with students and teachers demonstrated these principles in action. Take a look at this Storify from Year 4 and see the evidence for yourself. Are these principles a part of your practice?"

I wrote 10 different replies to this post and none of them sounded like it had any sense. So, this topic requires much more thinking before expressing an opinion.Thanks for that 🙂"
