I would add to that teachers can blog as a record of learning, it is a great way for new-scheme or pre-service teachers to showcase their own learning journeys. As well as keep records which they can use when applying for teaching standards or new jobs."

Since most teachers enjoy talking about teaching or other things, I suspect most would enjoy blogging.  I also think that Henriettami ‚Äòs suggestions are very worthwhile.  What a great way to chart your own growth as a teacher."

I am writing this in my first attempt at blogging. Actually, I am not really sure if I am really blogging as I wonder if commenting on someone else‚Äôs blog makes this a blog. Am I over thinking again? I am certainly using words that could be erased in order to make this ‚Äúblog‚Äù more concise but it reduces writing to its bare bones and makes reading so boring. So are there other teachers out there who know this is what I should be doing to stay current and connected but don‚Äôt truly get it?"
