Two precious little gifts, each with your own unique qualities and characteristics. When you were born, we wondered who you would be and since then, we have been observing with delight as you develop, grow and learn. What special gifts will you give to your brother, Matan?  … just like you? We look forward to finding out! Love, Granny and Grandpa."
