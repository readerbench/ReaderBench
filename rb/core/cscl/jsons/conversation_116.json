After much research, including reading, viewing and valuable conversations with experienced coaches, Joc and I have begun to coach teachers.  It’s part of an ever evolving approach to professional learning at our school, which includes teacher choice, a focus on growth rather than judgement and a desire to constantly refine and improve our practice. The content of coaching sessions is confidential, but we regularly reflect on the process and refine it as we go. Most of the teachers being coached are less concerned than we are about confidentiality. One shares her reflections in a meeting, another talks animatedly in the staffroom and a third is blogging about the experience! Here’s my take on the roles of the coach and the coachee…  I’ve already learned.. Next steps… Can we replace the old, evaluative model of teacher appraisal with a growth model, based on the coaching process? Watch this space…  "

As part of an ‘appraisal’ or professional growth framework I think the important thing is to match approach with needs.The value in learning to observe not to judge is one that has broad benefits, and something lots of people struggle with.So glad your school culture is such a receptive one to this approach and you and Joc are great people to lead the approach!"

I really like your cartoon. “Gather evidence” is an interesting one. What might this incorporate? Would you have it in the coachee box too? Some might expect to see feedback in there too but that could sit under gather evidence or observe.Your dot-point list captures the essence of effective coaching. The standouts for me are: seeing things through the eyes of the coachee; effective coaching builds positive relationships; and that teachers’ observations of their own practice are even more powerful that observations of others.Can’t wait to hear about the next steps!"

        "text": "https://tomwhitby.wordpress.com/2015/02/24/education-based-on-a-snapshot/My comment on this post:Tom, your post inspired me to share: This year for the first time, we are trialling having a ‘ coach teacher’. Our coach ( a previous full time classroom teacher who now coaches full time this year) Teachers sign up voluntarily if they have a goal they wish to achieve with the support of our coach – approx over a 6 week period. The purpose of her job is to mentor, advise, connect, and learn together with the member of staff. We all should have goals! Mine was for my class to connect globally ( in the most effective possible way ) with other Year 5 classes – Skype, blog, class twitter After a brief collaboration with my coach, we put some plans in action. She often pops in, sometimes we team teach or she videos my lessons and we ‘disect’ after. This is by no means a formal assessment of my teaching. It is positive criticism, solely to improve my teaching and to achieve my goal. ( Her job description was clarified by our principal ) While watching the video she was quiet and encouraged me to observe. Saw myself teaching and talking too much – repeating myself, explaining and re- explaining!!! Saw couple of students withdrawing from a session that sizzled at the start and then started to fizzle – kids wanted to get going while I was ‘ re- explaining’ ((if such a word exists) I was horrified! Am now extremely conscious of cutting out my talking and getting kids talking and doing. Being a PYP school, we focus heavily on student collaboration, independent inquiry etc.. I continue to do this but with minimal talk – My coach continues to video – amazing difference! ‘The proof of the pudding’ is the kids’ interaction and engagement from the start! I have shared this learning process with my students. Asked them to let me know when I start re- explaining and repeating. We have a sign. They stop me in my tracks…. I stop and let them move on…."

I am currently reviewing our PD model at our school, which includes a rethink about how we’re doing appraisals, and I am also very interested in learning more about coaching – so your blog came at a great time as it has links to all the areas I am looking at presently. I’m wondering, are there any books / readings you would recommend, or a coaching expert that you have worked with? I’d love to develop my skills in this area more but there is so much information, I’m finding it hard to know where to start!"

A coach historically was a vehicle in which people were carried-  I am by no means an etymology guru (but I would like to be :)) Does this mean that a coach in a teacher coaching relationship “carries” the coachee? I don’t think so based on my understanding of the process and your great toondoo… I wonder if there is a better word for this type of approach? Any idea what the justification for this language is? Just my random thoughts tonight… 🙂"

Specifically, I have been working on talking less, listening more and crafting purposeful questions. Do you have any advice or resources about how to craft purposeful questions to help teachers reflect on their own practice? Especially at this point in the year where many teachers are scheduling meetings with me and asking for my feedback about their teaching. I’d love to be able to help them reflect on their own teaching practice, but am unsure about where to begin with regards to crafting those types of powerful, self-reflective questions. Thanks!"
