This provides reassurance. Kath"

This piece captures that lifelong quest you see in teachers for the very best experience for their pupils‚Ä¶and their own contribution never quite reaches the bar they set themselves.If I could wave a magic wand I would want to take away that perfectionism yet retain that desire to teach to the highest standard.  Loved this poem."
