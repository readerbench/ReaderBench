        "text": " Just a little over two years ago, I wrote my first blog post. I never expected to have readers at all, let alone readers all over the world, many of whom would, over time, become my friends. A year later, I was thrilled to be nominated for the Edublog Awards and proudly displayed the nomination badges in the sidebar of my blog. I didn‚Äôt care about winning, it was enough to have an acknowledgement that people out there valued what I had to say. I nominated some of my favourite blogs, knowing that as soon I hit the publish button, I would think of others I could have or should have included.  Another year later, a self-confessed addict to both reading and writing blogs, I wouldn‚Äôt know which to choose if I had to nominate favourites. Instead, I have some thoughts to share‚Ä¶ I do have two favourite blogs I‚Äôd like to mention, for different reasons, even though I have personal investment in both. One is Inquire Within, a blog about inquiry learning in all its forms, which now has contributors from 14 different countries, across six continents. It‚Äôs great that many of the contributors are PYP teachers as I am, but even better that many are not as they provide different perspectives. I like the fact that anyone can contribute and that every post is a surprise because of the variety of voices. I love the commonality and the diversity. The other one is a class blog. Every class at my school now has a blog, and each one is at a different stage. My favourite is the 6D blog and only partly because I have taught that class and have an attachment to both the children and their class teacher! The blog is an extension of the classroom learning, a home for visible thinking and an opportunity for promoting authentic inquiry. I love that it‚Äôs messy and creative, as learning should be. Here‚Äôs what the two blogs have in common: inquiry, learning, authenticity, multiple voices, diversity, big ideas ‚Ä¶ and they each represent a community of learners."

So many wonderful things to read and think about. It‚Äôs like a horn of plenty.Brings to mind a coffee cup someone gave me. Tt says ‚ÄúSo many books. So little time.‚Äù  In the world of business we would call it a ‚Äúhigh class problem.‚Äù I‚Äôve been following your 6 Daled blog and tend to agree. Fresh voices confronting Big Ideas for the first time. it‚Äôs an inspiration and a breath of fresh air."

However, I still manage to have heaps of tabs open while I try to save to scoop.it or Evernote all of the bits and bobs I am reading and learning from!Have to agree wholeheartedly with your comments about ‚Äúteachers who aren‚Äôt reading education blogs and furthering their learning by engaging in social media are being left behind‚Äù ‚Äì we are no longer limited to the humble teacher only day PD or the drug induced comas we felt when on courses we were sent to! Open, relevant, challenging and up-to-the-minute PD is available free online every second of every day, if only we can get more educators to see that!As for selecting 1-2 fave blogs, I would have to list yours as one of mine! üôÇ"

Always an enjoyable read, choc a bloc with ideas I have dragged into my own staff room or discussed over coffee at Axil.However, the opportunities to comment on your posts have done much more for me. I am an occasional blogger, but have relished the chances to question my existing thinking and develop my thoughts, and push my teacher-inquiry further. I recommend any teacher to HIT REPLY to enrich the online conversations and their own thinking. Hey, what‚Äôs not to like about responding? Someone else has chosen a worthwhile topic, I only have to write a paragraph or two, I can challenge your writing and put forward questions to be built on by other responders. Through responding, I belong, I learn.CheersBrette"

My experiences are similar, although I must admit that I hardly ever look at Google Reader anymore, although I subscribe to numerous blogs there. Instead I read articles and blog posts that come across my Twitter stream, and share or re-share posts I find valuable via Twitter as well. This has helped me with the ‚Äúinformation overload‚Äù, and I find it much less overwhelming than trying to constantly manage my blog subscriptions.On this Thanksgiving weekend in the USA, one of the things I am thankful for is the vast amount of information and conversation that is available to us via the web and social media, and the almost equally vast number of ways we have to access it. üôÇ"

My BLEEK  (blog week) begins  early on a Sunday morning.. this is far more stimulating than the newspaper (which used to be first thing up on a Sunday) Then its a meander through twitter‚Ä¶. another blog or two ‚Ä¶. and my brain is filled with new ideas and thinking to mull over for a while. (sometimes I do shamefacedly admit in the Pilates gym class) ‚Äì Monday at school its a couple of conversations  with colleagues and more  thinking and adding ideas and connections. A few more blogs during the week quickly snatched between other work and family comittments.. (far easier than a day out for PD)I have loved my year with the blog and recently Twitter. The generosity of the you Edna and other bloggers have made this the best year ever for new learning. Thank you all."
