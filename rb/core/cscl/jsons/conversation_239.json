        "text": " Have you ever been¬†presented with PD and then had no time to follow up?  How often do you have an¬†uninterrupted¬†chunk of time to inquire into something that interests you, to push your thinking and improve your practice? Do you have enough opportunities to explore and think collaboratively, to unpack and discuss big ideas with others of varied experience? On Monday we will have a half day of professional¬†learning, different to any of our previous PD days. It‚Äôs based on a survey in which staff ¬†indicated their preferences for the structure and content of the day. Here‚Äôs what it said on the Google doc which was shared with teachers: This table shows by far the most popular choices in our survey.¬†Please put your name in the group you‚Äôd like to join. Use red if you are willing to facilitate the group inquiry (more than one person is fine!) Note: There will NOT be a presentation. The purpose is to work on a shared inquiry.  I have no idea how the morning will go, but, here‚Äôs what I do know‚Ä¶ A friend commented on the fact that I¬†often¬†write about innovations,¬†before¬†they happen. He thinks it demonstrates confidence on my part, since I am willing to blog before the vision becomes reality. Maybe. Or maybe not. Perhaps blogging in advance means that if it‚Äôs a failure, I can simply avoid writing about what went wrong! Or ¬†(more likely) ‚Ä¶ I like the excitement of visualising and planning new learning experiences, even if I can‚Äôt predict the outcome. Watch this space‚Ä¶ maybe!"

It was invigorating and having the time to actually do it is what kept me going. Back at work now I am putting my inquiry into practise and I‚Äôm loving it!  My principal has even asked me to share my work with the staff."

Maybe not possible but wouldn‚Äôt it be great if some one was able to document the types of questions they asked in the session using something like Google documents?

Probably a crazy idea and a bit personally motivated as I‚Äôm interested to know their questions on blogging and social media because it helps me help everyone better."
