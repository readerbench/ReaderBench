A conversation with Chetan, Akansha, Pravin and the others could have been doomed by the potential obstaclesâ€¦ The kids in Hyderabad Warming upâ€¦ Teacher as learnerâ€¦ We connect as human beingsâ€¦ Contrasting conversationsâ€¦"

I wonder how your communication would have been with you typing in English and them reading Hindi â€“ and vice versa?  Different, and probably better in terms of communication, but I canâ€™t help thinking that something charming and important would have been lost tooâ€¦"

She had inadvertently muted her microphone so we had some fun trying to get it back working.I agree though, while new technology is amazing there is nothing like body language and facial expressions to really get your message across."

And see what changes take place even in this short time. The group you spoke to on Tuesday will be there again on Thursday and Saturday, todayâ€™s should be there on Monday, Wednesdays, Fridays..  One interesting comment, following the faces Akanksha was making at you  ðŸ™‚  , was their thrill that they could do this with an older â€˜authorityâ€™ figure. They absolutely canâ€™t imagine doing something like this with one of their teachers!  Now if  feeling free encourages them to ask questions and learnâ€¦. I am all for it. More later [information about the group]"

We all need to become more culturally proficient to understand the complexities of our rapidly evolving world. Hopefully this is a step in the right direction!Safina Noorani"
