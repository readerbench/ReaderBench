        "text": " As a ¬†PYP school, we emphasise inquiry and focus on promoting higher order thinking, through powerful central ideas and a concept based curriculum. In the few years since we first implemented the PYP, we‚Äôve really seen our students‚Äô thinking develop. The more they are exposed to big ideas and encouraged to engage them with them, the more they ‚Äòwow‚Äô us with the the depth of their thinking and the way they articulate it. I wonder if they would have answered the same way, a few years back. I wonder what they would have thought of the question! I wonder what they‚Äôll be like in another 5 years‚Ä¶ I love Emma‚Äôs idea that a goal of education is to find out what you‚Äôre good at. It reminded me of something I heard in a TED talk I listened to the other day. In his talk on teaching kids to be entrepeneurs, Cameron Herold says it‚Äôs a shame that kids are given tutors in the areas they‚Äôre not good at. How much better would it be if they had extra coaching in the things they‚Äôre ¬†talented at and passionate about?! Which response appeals to you?"

To me, education is about discovering ourselves and the world around us, in a fun and inquisitive way, so that we can constantly learn and grow to reach our full potential, both in terms of ourselves and our contributions to others."

So glad he recognizes the possibilities! Please share these with your faculty.  It might inspire others to ask the same question!"

See the top musicians, mathematicians, rabbis, etc, etc. Alas education today is about passing exams (hence the tutors in the weak subjects) and not about striving for excellence for its own sake."

        "text": "These are all great responses.  At his age, I had the same idea as Matthew, that knowledge needs to be passed on.  Now, I probably feel more like Josh, that education should expand the way we think.  With regard to the coaching, I think some children are lucky enough to find people who will help them with their passions.  I do think that Cameron Herold‚Äôs idea of coaching for weak areas is a good one.  I have no interest in sport because I was no good at most of the sports I did at school.  When I had coaching in fencing and tennis, it spurred an interest because it showed me that I could succeed in some sports.  Such coaching does need to be sustained and sustainable, if it‚Äôs going to be effective, though.  It‚Äôs worth pointing out to your students that adults also have equally varied ideas about what the goal of education is or should be‚Ä¶ as the #edchat discussion highlighted!"

An opportunity to be exposed to a lot of different learning, content, and discovery so that students can find out where their passions lie.  Excellent responses!  As I compared the answers to the answers my students gave, it is obvious to me that our schools look very different.  The answers my students gave centered around testing and getting into a good college.  Your students answers reflected a school where inquiry and discovery is encouraged with the emphasis on learning and the process.  I hope more schools begin to look like that!"
