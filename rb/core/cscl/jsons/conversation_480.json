        "text": " The PYP curriculum emphasises the development of 5 essential elements: knowledge, concepts,skills, attitudes and action.  Ideally, responsible, student-initiated action comes as a result of the learning process.  It may be an extension of students’ learning or it may have a wider social impact.  The PYP action model allows students the opportunity to choose to act, decide on their actions, and then reflect, in order to make a difference.  Kiran Bir Sethi of Riverside School in Ahmedabad, talks about being infected by the ‘I can‘ bug.  She says empowering children to take responsibility moves them from ‘Teacher told me’ to ‘I can. ‘   Watch this inspiring TED talk to see what student action can look like.   PYP Key Concept: Responsibility. Series of posts through the lens of key concepts of PYP."

This year we have just started a student council at school and we are definitely seeing a lot more student initiated action as a result."
