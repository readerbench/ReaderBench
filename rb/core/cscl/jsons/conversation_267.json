        "text": " Dear Heads and Co-ordinators, Thanks for being such an appreciative audience at theÂ PYP network meeting. Iâ€™m glad you enjoyed my presentation about what it means to be a connected educator. It didnâ€™t matter that it was the end of a long day and a long meeting or that we were all tired before I even started to speak. It didnâ€™t matter that Twitter is blocked at the host school and I couldnâ€™t even show you a live Twitter interaction. It didnâ€™t matter that the internet stopped working and I had to talk my way round images of blogs and ningsÂ instead of showing them to you. It didnâ€™t matter that most people were taking pen and paper notes in a session about the use of technology. It didnâ€™t matter that some of you have yet to take the first step into this world of perpetual learning. We are all educators and we care deeply about learning.  As soon as you saw whatâ€™s possible in terms of learning, both our own and our studentsâ€™, I saw the light in your eyes.  I liked how you smiled when you saw I had borrowed some of my lines Â from Steven Andersonâ€™s video, which I showed at the end. It gave you a glimpse into the sharing and collaboration that is so much part of being a connected educator.  You seemed to enjoy being introduced to individual members of my PLN (most of whom I have yet to meet myself!) and hearing about how they have inspired me. I wish Iâ€™d had time to tell you what I have learned from each of them. I was delighted by your enthusiastic response to our global plant inquiry and the way we use Skype to connect our students with the world. It was great to see you talking amongst yourselves about how you could apply some of the ideas I shared. I liked the fact that you laughed at the image of the toe in the water because you could relate to it. Either because youâ€™ve already put yours in and seen the result, or because you felt that makingÂ  just a small start isnâ€™t too intimidating. I loved that people came up to me afterwards to say that they were ready to put their toes in the water for the first time and begin their exploration. They were inspired, not by my presentation itself, but by their understanding of the enormous potential for learning. Looking forward to welcoming you to my personal learning networkâ€¦. Edna  Thanks @klbeasely for the inspiration."
