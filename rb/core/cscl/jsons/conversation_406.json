        "text": " This morning I read @davidweesâ€™s well written, sad but true, post entitled A Day in the Life of a Student. From that childâ€™s perspective, school is a pointless and unrewarding experience. And yes, we need to work hard to change that model of school.Â But school doesnâ€™t have to look like that. My inspiration for this post comes from some of the wonderful bloggers who share their practice generously with the worldâ€¦ A ( different) day in the life of a studentâ€¦ I wake up in the morning earlier than I want to. Iâ€™d rather stay in bedâ€¦ but wouldnâ€™t everyone? Once fully awake though, I remember some of the Â exciting things happening at school and feel more positive about the day ahead. I arrive at school and jostle through the over crowded hallway to get to Mr Riceâ€™s science class. I Â look forward to science because Mr Rice has a way of hooking me in with a provocation that gets my imagination going. He asks questions that get me thinking of even more questions, rather than answers. I love the way he gives us plenty of time to gather materials and find things out for ourselves, but helps us figure out stuff if we need him. I always know if Iâ€™m on the right track because he gives me constructive, explicit feedback. Today weâ€™re playing with cornstarch and water to see what happens and Iâ€™m so engaged in my learning that I donâ€™t even notice when the bell goes! You wouldnâ€™t believe it, but my next class is â€˜show and tellâ€™. I havenâ€™t done that since I was 7!Â Mr Spencer is an awesome writer and genuinely caring person, not just a teacher. He really listens to what we say, but more than that, he hears what I donâ€™t say too. Bringing something personal for todayâ€™s class is an opportunity to give something of myself in a secure setting. I can tell that Mr Spencer cares about what Iâ€™ve brought and wants to know more about why Iâ€™ve chosen it, which makes it a little easier to open up and share something so personal with the whole class. I know itâ€™s helping him see me as a whole person with a story of my own.  I have a math test in my next class. I usually hate tests because learning is collaborative and suddenly they expect you to do everything on your own. Sometimes I panic because they say the grades are important and so I forget things I actually knew how to do. Itâ€™s different in Mr Leeâ€™s class because of the Twitter back-channel. I look forward to tests! We use our handheld devices to communicate with each other if we need some support. Sounds like cheating doesnâ€™t it? But it isnâ€™t really, because math is not about getting an answer, itâ€™s about a process. Collaboration is a key part of functioning in society today after all, and memorization isnâ€™t. Iâ€™m taking my lunch toÂ Ms Millerâ€™s Bloggers Cafe. She knows I have better things to do after school, but that doesnâ€™t mean I donâ€™t want to write. Blogging helps me reflect on my learning and Ms Miller says Iâ€™m developing my writing skills. Reading blogs by students around the world gives me a better understanding of other people and other cultures. Â But the most motivating thing of all is to find comments on my posts, written by people I donâ€™t even know yet. Knowing I have a real live audience makes me want to write more and more. Itâ€™s easy to forget that my next class takes place in a room with four walls. We use Skype with Ms Tolisano to learn from and with other teachers and learners around the world. This makes learning really meaningful. I mean, itâ€™s not like teachers know everything there is to know and this is the 21st century, so why not communicate with people out there in every way thatâ€™s possible? For our research into Christopher Columbus, she called for â€˜expertsâ€™ worldwide to Skype with us, Â teachers and classes of all ages and backgrounds, to help us gain the broadest perspective possible. Who would have thought learning could be so cool? I could go on and on. There are enough innovative teachers out there doing brilliant things to fill thousands of blog posts every day.  Educational reform? One passionate teacher at a time."

I had not read David Wees post before and it made me sad, as I am sure that my own children suffer days like this sometimes. I wish I, or indeed anyone knew the answer to this conundrum. I hope and pray though, that slowly and surely the message of reform will get through."

Before I even knew what your post was about, I read the original day in the life of a student and was wondering why anyone would want to be so negative â€“ thatâ€™s not the way it has to be and itâ€™s not the way it is everywhere! (I know the post was tongue in cheek and trying to make a point but still).Thanks so much for highlighting that there are plenty of teachers who are making a difference!I try to take a postive attitude wherever I go and Iâ€™m glad you do too ðŸ™‚"

If his writing created as much thinking in others as with you he accomplished his mission. I see some of the happiest kids in the world. They love being at school and canâ€™t wait to see me each morning. I spend about an hour each morning 7-8 enjoying their company while they are eating breakfast, visiting, reading, finishing an assignment, and sharing stories with me. What a way to start the day! Maybe we need to create a PBS4Teachers -Positive Blogging Site for Teachers. Anyone can post but it must be about kids,teachers and/or parents and be a true story that is written in a passionate, positive style. Hey Edna, you would be the perfect person to get the ball rolling."
