Help them master the skill or understand the concept or find the information or make sense of the ideas… ‘In this rare clip from 1972, legendary psychiatrist and Holocaust-survivor Viktor Frankl delivers a powerful message about the human search for meaning — and the most important gift we can give others.’ (TED) Can we take the message of the flying lesson into the classroom? If, to quote Frankl, instead of taking our students as they really are and ‘making them worse,’ instead we ‘overestimate them‘, will they be more likely to live up to our expectations? If we ‘promote them to what they really can be,’ will they be more likely to reach their potential? If we encourage our students to aim high, will they fly?"

This is such a great reminder, we have to be idealist, we have to give students the opportunities to surprise us and surpass all of our expectations.  Our words and actions have a powerful impact on students.  When we tell them they are great, they believe us.  When we tell them and show them that they can do anything that they set their minds to, they will do that thing.  Our words are powerful, when we build a student up, they believe that they can do it and they aim for that great thing."
