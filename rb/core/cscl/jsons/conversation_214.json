I’m a huge fan of Dropbox for storing presentations and photos, my documents (collaborative and independent) reside in Google Drive, my lists are in Workflowy and my beloved (!) blog isn’t backed up anywhere… just for a start! I’ve ignored his reluctance to trust the cloud and laughed at his suggestions of the possibility of losing my data.  It turns out that I am naive. Searching through some old posts today, I discovered, by accident, that a slide show created in PhotoPeach is no longer accessible. A quick check of the site led me to this announcement (and no slide shows!)… Important message: We have encountered a problem while upgrading our servers to accommodate the growing data and traffic. Some slide shows created from Jun 2010 to December 18 2012 will not be accessible at this time. (December 20, 2012) Affected data recovery for up to 50% of our users has unfortunately not succeeded at this time. All PhotoPeach features are still available and we have upgraded our data management systems. Again, we sincerely apologize and hope you will continue to enjoy PhotoPeach. For a detailed explanation of what occurred and information regarding refunds for affected premium users, please click here. So, now I’m wondering… Should I trust the cloud? Or should I admit he was right? 🙂"

Do I have room for another lever arch file on my bookshelf? Should I copy the copies?”I also recall the moments I have lost files, usually older ones, and then shrugged off the loss and recreated something better!However, chronicling our own professional learning journey is easily done online. I would hate to lose useful stuff, and stuff that has defined me as a learner. Hmm, now to go and back up a few of the things that really count before TOS and archive access change.cheersBrette"

        "text": "Points well made by other commenters Edna.There are two slightly different aspects to this I feel: firstly there are artifacts (files/photos) which can (and should) be stored both online and offline. As others have rightly pointed out, each has its merits and neither is safer than the other I’d argue.Secondly there are the creations like PhotoPeaches that you make online. An offline version isn’t an option, unless the tool offers a download (like Prezi). So where we use online tools to make unique products, then that has to be on the understanding that they might actually be rather more ephemeral than those created by offline tools. Just something to come to be aware of perhaps … and be ready for those student excuses “PhotoPeach ate my homework.”"

Worse was that it was a shared account and was deleting stuff from someone else’s computer too!  Thankfully she’d got a separate back-up…Ignoring user stupidity, I wonder if the cloud storage has less risk if you’re paying for it (directly) than if you aren’t. I’ve never inspected the legal terms closely.Further ramblings:I’m happy that I’ve lost some stuff – like my naive comments in user groups when the Internet was in its infancy – wish it’d lose more of those – destined to haunt me forever!  (I shouldn’t have mentioned this, should I?!)I file stuff in the cloud and manage to forget where I’ve put it. Then when I rediscover it I often wonder who wrote such words of excellence (rarely) or such crap (often!)Will all this junk haunt my descendents for all eternity?Will my descendents be able to access my accounts to retrieve their inheritance?Was that really “whatedshusbandsaid” ? If so, Hi!"
