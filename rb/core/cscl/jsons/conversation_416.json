        "text": " I loved the discussion that grew out of my ‘10 things teachers should UNlearn‘ post. It was inspired by the Yoda clip and I deliberately did not elaborate on each point, so as to provoke thinking and responses. I have posted separately about most of the points on other occasions anyway. One of the points which raised problems for some people was my suggestion that students are not obliged to respect teachers.  I do think mutual respect between any human beings is important. And I understand that there might be differing cultural expectations when it comes to respecting teachers. But I still think it’s important for teachers to think about whether and why they deserve respect automatically.  By whatedsaid | View this Toon at ToonDoo | Create your own Toon 10 ways to get your students’ respect… (for those who don’t think it comes automatically) 1. Respect your students. Don’t talk down to students. Model mutual respect.  Don’t have double standards. Give what you’d like to get back. Know every child’s story and treat each as an individual. Cater for different learning preferences, strengths and weaknesses. 2. Have a class agreement, not top-down rules. Ask what helps them learn and what hinders learning. Use that as a basis for establishing an essential agreement as to how the class will run and what behaviours will be evident. Have everyone sign it. Put it up on the wall. Refer to it constantly. 3.  Be part of the learning community. Don’t be the boss of learning. Encourage kids to take ownership of their learning. Be an inquirer too. Don’t pretend to know all the answers. Learn with and from your students. Divide your groups in a variety of random ways, so that everyone learns to work with different people. 4. Acknowledge their physical needs. Allow students to drink water and even to eat if they hungry. Don’t try and control when they go to the toilet. (If your classes are engaging, they will only go when they need to.) Provide opportunities for standing up and moving around during learning. 5. Be fair and reasonable. Don’t show favoritism.  Expect everyone to stick to the agreement. Don’t allow put-downs between students. Accept legitimate excuses and even some that might not be. If the homework comes a day late because they had something else to do, it’s not the end of the world. 6. Have a sense of humour. Laugh with your students but never at them. Laugh at yourself. Show firm disapproval if they laugh at each other.  Don’t take school too seriously. Take learning seriously. But make learning fun too. 7.  Provide  a secure learning space. Provide opportunities for risk-taking in learning. Create a safe environment where learners don’t fear failure. Be supportive of creative thinking and new ways of doing things. Make every student feel validated. 8. Be sincere. Talk to students in a normal tone, irrespective of their age.  Students see through adults who aren’t sincere very quickly. Don’t pretend.   Say what you mean. Mean what you say. Show that you care… but only if you do. (If you don’t, why are you a teacher?) 9. Be human. Acknowledge when you’re in the wrong. Apologise when you make a mistake. Admit you’re impatient because you’re tired today. 10. Let go. Don’t be in charge of every situation.  Ask yourself  ‘Is it important?‘ before you react. Don’t make all the decisions. Provide opportunities for choice. Show that you value initiative above compliance. 10 (ways) series… "

        "text": "I too loved the discussion that grew out of my ‘10 things teachers should UNlearn‘ post.  I was a big contributor to that “respect dialogue” you mentioned, as I cannot stress enough to new teachers how crucial respect is.  A huge problem with new teachers is they mistake respect with friendship.DO NOT BE A FRIEND TO YOUR STUDENTS!  THEY HAVE ENOUGH FRIENDS!To illustrate this point, if my friend tells me to “shut up,” I might slug him on the arm and tell HIM to “shut up.”  However, if my student tells me to shut up, he or she knows there will be immediate consequences for disrespect.Yes, follow all 10 bits of sage advice on the list above, but DO NOT blend the lines of TEACHER/ student, or the necessary respect will be impossible to maintain.If you are interested in a more in-depth explanation or discussion of this idea check out my post on the topic at http://wp.me/s11oWO-398"

Teachers who engage their students through embedding learning in contexts that are authentic to them, have meaningful and hopefully applicable outcomes and require deep learning and higher order thinking, combined with the belief that each and very students can achieve, will earn life-long (or even longer) respect. I still hear my 85 year old Dad talk about teachers he respected and why he respected them"

        "text": "A lot of it depends on what example you set. Yes, we need to show respect for students if we expect it in return, but we also need to show how we as teachers respect other teachers. This can be done I a number of ways. As professionals we don’t always get along with our colleagues but we should show some level of respect. Students will pick up on snyde remarks or a rolling of the eyes, or any other form of disapproval/disrespect. We can’t expect students to be respectful in another’s classroom if you yourself don’t show any respect for that teacher. I think that it also teaches another important message–you don’t have to “like” everyone, but you can certainly get along with (most) everyone. Respect, at least for me, is something has to be modeled. I learned respect from watching how my dad and mom treated others. I learned respect from teachers that treated me as a person and not a subordinate. We can talk all we want to the kids (especially younger grades) about what respect looks like, but it means very little until they actually see it."

Too often teachers get into a power struggle with his/her students because after all they are the teacher. They may win that battle but they have lost the war because they have lost the respect of that student and possibly the class for a long time. another things teachers forget and sometimes students as well is that the teacher needs to be fair but fair doesn’t always mean equal.I would also agree with Jeremy’s comment that one important factor in the issue of respect is that teachers need to be role models and model respect for their students by the way they interact with others.Thanks for the postAkevy"

I’m not sure that can even be called respect, more likely it is fear.  True respect is mutual between both parties who care about each other and feel safe in that respectful relationship.  Great 10 list!"

The other day during circle time, one of my K students told me, “I feel mad.” I eventually got the reason- he was mad because he wanted to stay home that day with his mom. I told him, “You know Alan, I was mad this morning too. I wanted to stay home with my dog. But here we are.” His face lit up. I told the truth and may have hooked him for the year!#9 Be human. Never be “perfect.” Kids hate “perfect.” “Perfect” creates anxiety, not respect."

What do would you tell about who to show love and respect to all those students at the same tim? Thanks"
