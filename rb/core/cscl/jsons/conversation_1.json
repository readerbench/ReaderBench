        "text": " The generosity of educators, authors, artists, businesses and all manner of other unexpected sources, currently sharing their time and ideas via social media, is phenomenalâ€¦ yet overwhelming. One can drown in the ocean of views on remote learning, examples of schedules, suggested activities, tools and platforms, ways of staying connected, tips for being mindful, advice for checking in with children, etc etc Stepping away from it all gives me time and space to be creative and generate ideas. Creativity benefits from constraints. What if that was the focus of the learning? What if, instead of trying to replicate or reinvent school, we allowed this to be a time of creativity? What if we took advantage of the way limitations can encourage innovation? What if these sorts of guiding questions were offered as provocations for teachers and students alike? What if the above questions were supported and extended by ones like these? What if we all viewed the limitations of our current context as an opportunity for creativity and innovation?"
