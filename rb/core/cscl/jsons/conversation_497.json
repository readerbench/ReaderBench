Here are a few of them… Would you ask your students to consider these? Take a few minutes to think… How would you respond to them, as a learner yourself? "

I liked this because I felt it tapped into what they thought was important and made them think about the way in which they want to make a difference themselves.I also asked them to think how all the central ideas we have covered throughout the year connected with this day and I was blown away with the complexity of their understandings, the way they connected their learning through graphic organisers and the thought they gave to their responses."

I fall into the trap of getting carried away and trying to lead too much and not simply (or not so) set it up and step back and allow students to take charge of learning – which is how i learn best!! But sometimes when wearing my teacher hat i forget that!! And get too involved instead of letting learning evolve!Will pose these questions this week and see what response i get.Your blog is inspirational and it provides a shortcut to thoughtprovoking material!! Keep it up."

I like to include children in the learning process and often ask them what they think will be a better way of learning for them. It works. They are amazing with what they come up with. The video was interesting and it kind of startled me that kids are so aware about their learning at such a young age.Thanks for everything you are putting on the blog Ed, it always gives me food for thought, helps me learn and gives me inspirational ideas to hopefully  better my teaching practise so that I can call myself a teacher of the 21st Century."
