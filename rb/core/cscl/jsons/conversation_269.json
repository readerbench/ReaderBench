        "text": " Does your school run compulsory, one-size-fits-all PD? Are you ever bored, disinterested or unmotivated when attending? ¬†Have you ever been to a conference where the presenter was dull, the audience passive and the content unengaging? Fortunately, we have the power to create our own more effective professional learning opportunities. What‚Äôs yours? Daily connection with other educators via social media? Online workshops and webinars by educators for educators? Teachmeets, where educators meet and share practice informally? One of the many Twitter chats dedicated to different areas of learning? Keen responses to a tweet from @wholeboxndice a few days ago motivated us to try and establish #pypchat, a Twitter chat for IB PYP educators. While the discussion will be PYP related, it‚Äôs all about learning and anyone will be welcome to participate. A preliminary survey to assess the level of interest quickly attracted responses from every continent. It‚Äôs unlikely we can find a suitable time to accommodate people in all the time zones, but it‚Äôs encouraging to have so much interest expressed so quickly. It‚Äôs interesting to note that nearly half the responders so far indicated that they would like to be part of the team of moderators. It‚Äôs an opportunity to create our own professional learning. DIY. Why not? (Survey here. Details soon)"

        "text": "Spot on post‚Ä¶The DIY professional learning that I‚Äôve been involved in has always been the most interesting and beneficial. The impact it has on my teaching is usually immediate. Maybe I read about a new tech tool on twitter and then I work it in to my class. Or I am emailed about changes to the maths IBDP curriculum so we set up an informal meeting with peers to discuss initials concerns/questions and next steps. It‚Äôs relevant.  Too often I think that the compulsory PD that is set by schools is actually simply ‚Äúin-service‚Äù ‚Äì a chance to get that stuff completed to check a box on somebody else‚Äôs task list. Great for them. But the rest of us cry at the thought of what could‚Äôve been‚Ä¶. (yes yes, slightly melodramatic!)We‚Äôve set up a posterous site for our own DIY PD. It‚Äôs called The Collaborative Learner (http://collaborativelearner.posterous.com/) and it‚Äôs a no rules blog where we share ideas and experiences. Also, just recently at our school @danmagie has set up the Peer Observation month which is really very much inline with the idea behind DIY PD. Check out the ideas and structure here: http://professionalgrowth.posterous.com/"

        "text": "Hey Edna,Another great post from my favourite educational blogger!!Twitter has opened up a whole new world for me regarding professional development, reading and interaction over the last 6 months or so. Combined with a lot of the work I‚Äôm doing at uni as part of my course work, I‚Äôm feeling very good about my own professional development & learning for the first time in many years.A constant complaint I‚Äôve had at my current school is that there is no / very little differentiation for professional development / staff training. As an experienced teacher with about 25 years‚Äô experience in systemic and international schools, I‚Äôm still forced to sit through some sessions with teachers assistants who aren‚Äôt trained as teachers or beginning teachers, oft times doing things I‚Äôve done on numerous occasions. While I‚Äôm happy to support my younger colleagues, I still want something that is going to benefit me! This is where my uni course work and a range of readings and interactions on Twitters and blogs like yours has got me stimulated.I‚Äôm hoping that school heads and administrators are keeping up with current practice when recruiting and look past the long list of workshops that someone may have attended. I hope they  start recognising teachers that have developed Personal Learning Networks (PLNs) and been pro-active about their own learning. I know that when I leave my current school at the end of 4 years ( or we may even stay for a 5th) that I‚Äôll have 1 PYP Workshop under my belt and not much else.Keep up the good work Ed"
