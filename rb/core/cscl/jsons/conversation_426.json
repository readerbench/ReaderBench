        "text": "    The Next Step by @mrplough07 Corey has started an initiative in which he calls for nominations on a particular theme of education blog each week, creates a poll and then features the â€˜winningâ€™ blog. His goal (see details here) is to highlight EdBlogs and encourage bloggers to support each other.Â I was honoured to be featured this week! It got me thinking (again!) about the power and generosity of the online educator community. It never ceases to amaze me how educators help, encourage, support and promote each other, through blogs and Twitter. Blogging in the Primary Classroom by @oliverquinlan I have only recently discovered this thoughtful blog and still need to catch up on Oliverâ€™s past posts. His latest post deals with physical classroom space and Â he sums it up by saying â€˜the thinking on innovative use of space should start with pedagogy not practicality,â€™ and adds that it should be about the learning, not the teaching. It made me think about how many teachers arrange their rooms in a way thatâ€™s practical for them, or allows for better â€˜teacher controlâ€™ (!) rather than to facilitate learning. (I think this will be a future post for me, thanks Oliver!) Clive in Sri Lanka by @CliveSir Iâ€™m loving this blog (although I wish he wouldnâ€™t talk about me), not just for what Clive shares about his teaching in Sri Lanka, but for the connection to another colorful world and culture. Iâ€™m not even sure how I first discovered it, but I have since been interacting with Clive and am interested in the development of his classes for computer teachers. Clive worked as an engineer for more than twenty years, before setting off to volunteer in the developing world. My own children have volunteered in India and Ecuador respectively and itâ€™s something I would like to do myself one day, so his story resonates for me.Â I am also fascinated by what brings people to teaching, in itâ€™s various forms, and what they get out of it as well as what they put in. Iâ€™d love to hear about some blogs that made you think this weekâ€¦ Series ofÂ posts: Blogs that made me think this week.. #2 Blogs that made me think this week #1 "

Its been really enlightening doing the edBlog project, getting opinions about high quality blogs from my PLN and then watching how people select.  There are so many great blogs and a lot people can easily get caught up in the rapid fire microblogging of Twitter that they may not take the time to read more in depth ideas.  Great blog, and congrats again on the online educator community selecting yours."

I also wonder how people who donâ€™t read the ideas of others are growing. I started mine simply for reflecting on what was going on in my classroom, and I am so glad to have grown in the process."
