Earlier this year, we developed a unit of inquiry into digital citizenship for our Year 5 students and I’m currently preparing to facilitate a three day workshop for teachers exploring the same topic. As a result, I’ve been thinking a great deal about what, for me, is simply a part of my everyday life. On any given day (aside from work and play!) I might write a blog post, read and comment on others, join a twitter chat, search for information, find videos to spark learners’ curiosity, Skype with my grandson, interact with children at one of the School in the Cloud settings in India, respond to applications for the ‘granny cloud’, chat with a friend in another part of the world… Using the key concepts of the PYP as a lens,  I’ve come up with 10 understandings about digital citizenship for teachers and learners (or teachers as learners) to explore… Do you think I have missed anything? And later… a tweet from @flipoz hits the nail on the head… @whatedsaid v interesting. I wonder about the connections & interactions between these elements as the key to tchg & undrstndng dig citizshp — Philip Williams (@flipoz) April 27, 2014   This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported License."

Perhaps its the changing context you set that I think explains the reasons why its important to explore these that’s equally important. Each one of us has this changing context and it would be interesting to explore teachers digital footprint for their contexts as well."
