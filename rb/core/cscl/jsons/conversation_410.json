        "text": " For the Year 6 unit on social inequities,  Max and Emmit chose to inquire into Autism and the way Autistic people are treated. You’ll need to read these moving reflections by the boys (published with their permission) to appreciate what it meant in this particular context… Max: When the unit began, I was thinking of doing my exhibition on lack of water in India, but then one day a guest speaker came to the school and they talked about Aspergers, saying it was a disability. Being an Aspergian myself,  I decided to raise awareness about how Aspergers is not a disability, in fact in some cases, it is a gift. I thought hard about a lot of questions I could use. At first, I was going to do kids that are bullied at school due to their Autism, but then I decided that a bigger problem in the Autistic world was the lack of access to jobs by Aspergians. When I was looking for information it was hard find any real solid evidence such as graphs or statistics, people on the internet just wrote things like ‘Aspergians may sometimes have difficulties trying to find jobs’ but no real facts on the subject. I do not think this is very good, because I have no real facts to show anyone and I will just have to tell you my non-backed-up evidence like: Some Aspergians are thought to be disabled because people sometimes put ads on TV or other types of media telling the public that Aspergers is a disability and makes the bearer ‘stupid’ or ‘weird’. Not only is this not true, but it is the complete opposite of the truth. Some Aspergians excel way beyond ‘normal’ people. If I had any solid evidence I would put it all in this recount, but unfortunately, I don’t. This probably frustrates me as much as you, but there is nothing I can do. Thank you for listening though. Emmit: For my inquiry, I had to choose a social inequity and take action on it.  I chose autistic inequities. This affects me as one of my best friends, Max, who is also my research partner, has PDD-NOS, a form of high functioning Autism on the Autistic spectrum scale.  We would like to take action so Max and other people like him don’t face prejudice and discrimination, when really they are normal good people, capable of doing great things. There are many problems and inequities regarding Autistic people. With the right support services in place, all autistic people are capable of living meaningful and fulfilling lives. However, negative media coverage and deliberate pity campaigning have created the public opinion that autism is a ‘tragedy that needs to be stopped’, and that people with Autism have no hope of achieving anything.  Unfortunately, the media, shows kids throwing tantrums and parents complaining about their lives. It is rare to see Autistic kids on TV in normal activities and even rarer to see autistic adults. What they don’t realize is that Autism is what makes them who they are, regarding character, beliefs, tastes, and many other traits, and that there is no ‘normal’ person behind the Autism. And thus by trying to cure them, you’re really just trying to destroy who they are. This is very damaging to Autistic people and their image to other people, as it worsens social avoidance, pity, employment and workplace discrimination, and makes parents believe in false hopes of a cure instead of actually helping their kids. Money is spent on research in genetics, rather than proven support services and therapies. Max and I aim to raise awareness about this issue and inform people that Autism is not a disease. Let’s help them raise awareness. "

Your insightful posts about ‘Who I am.. ‘ were thought provoking not just for your peers but for those of us privileged to work with you  and those like me who are able to read your posts.You commented on the labeling of those who have special and unique qualities as being uninformed and prejudiced. I agree with you but you have moved the debate to be about accepting who we all are with our strengths and challenges.I have taught many children with lots of different challenges : intellectual, physical and social and yet I probably learnt more from them about what it means to be human than they may have learnt from me. Together we learnt about life.I plan to share this blog at an IBO conference in NZ next week if that’s OK with you. What you share with your learning community and the world is truly awesome and I am thankful that you are a part of my world.All the best with your very important inquiry into something that truly matters.Rob"

I think you have raised a very good point about the way the media portrays people with autism or Aspergers. We have several students at our school on the austism spectrum and I also have a family member with autism. I have learned such a lot from them, and certainly agree that people with autism should not be pigeon holed. They are all individuals with different skills, talents and personalities. Good luck with the rest of your inquiry. I look forward to reading more about it."

When my son was at school he was sent on work experience to a wonderful school that had students that many other schools  would not accept.  Some had autism, some had Down Syndrome, some had other issues that had excluded them from schools.  This experience transformed his life and after the end of his work experience he continued to act as a “big brother” to one of the boys at the school with autism, taking him out every weekend and generally doing things with him which may sound simple but actually made a big difference in his life:  for example he took him on public transport, taught him to take turns playing card games and so on – simple things that he had never done before.  My son is now at university and wants to become a teacher of teenagers with special needs.  What you say is so true Emmit:  we have to accept and support people the way they are and not try to change them into the way we want them to be."

Recently, an important family of my school went through the process of determining that their child, an 8 year-old, is a student with Aspergers.  This child has struggled with fitting into school and making true friendships.  Hearing the diagnosis of Autism for the mother was particularly difficult as she now knew that this was not something he was going to grow out of.  She is now learning so much and understanding that this IS who her son is and all the amazing things he can do with his gift.I sent her this blog and she came to the school to thank me for sending it.  Her son has so many talents and it is because of his Aspergers that he has these talents.  He does have challenges that other students do not have but your words helped her to see the gifts that her child has and how this will help him in his lifetime.We need to do more of exactly what you are doing:  be proud of who we are and see the strengths within each one of us.

In other words, he’s similar to a lot of other kids his age with or without the Aspergian label. It’s been so lovely to see the multitude of positive feedback on this site.
