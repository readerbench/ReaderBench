        "text": " Considering whether, what and how to blog about ACEC 2010, the inspiring conference which I attended last week, made me think further about what learning looks like. Â (I posted â€˜What does learning look like?â€˜ last week ). Â As a learner myself, I needed some time to process everything. Â I needed to talk with other learnersÂ about what I had heard Â in order to construct meaning for myself. Â I needed to relate it to other learning I have done. Â I needed to think about how I might apply what I learned. Rather than detailing the content of the sessions I attended, all of which are available online anyway Iâ€™m sure, Iâ€™ve chosen one of the thinking routines from Project Zero, as a way to share what I came away with. Â For examples of how other routines work, see my posts using 3-2-1 Bridge, Â I used to think.. Now I think, Â 4 Câ€™s and Connect Extend Challenge. These are excellent routines for scaffolding thinking, no matter what age your students are! Compass Points: Â (slightly adapted, but thatâ€™s an advantage of thinking routines)  What Excites me? What Worries me? What additional information do I Need? Whatâ€™s my Strategy for moving forward? It was only after I had chosen â€˜Compass Pointsâ€™ as the thinking routine I wanted to use, that I realised the appropriateness of the metaphor. Â Education is moving in new directions!  Series ofÂ posts based on Project Zero Thinking Routines #6  "

I think your post would be a great model to share with people, in order to help them understand how to use blogs to organise ideas and express them.  Beautiful work!"

I love the way youâ€™ve illustrated your thinking with the Compass Points, and another fabulous toondoo creation.I really enjoy reading your posts â€“ you have a way of sharing your thinking and reflections that is succinct, clear and thought-provoking."

I always thought those tech focused conferences were only for ICT, too. ðŸ™‚  I was happily surprised when I attended my first conference."

I know that as a classroom teacher I have come away with so many inspiring ideas not to mention connections with teachers such as yourself that I feel I have grown immeasurably. My goal going forward is to keep chipping away at my school, in the hope that the ripple of interest in the internet and web 2.0 will one day become a wave."

When I reflect on my experience at the AELS 2010 I feel exactly the same:  excited at meeting other learners and inspired by what they are doing, and also empowered to continue in the direction we are heading with the IT here in Switzerland.  Like you I am concerned that we need to reach all our teachers not just the few who are already on board with using technology, and like you I feel I am totally addicted to all the new learning I am doing every day using the internet.  As always, thanks for sharing your thoughts Edna."
