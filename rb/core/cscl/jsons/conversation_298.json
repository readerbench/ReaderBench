        "text": " During the two year life of this blog I’ve written several reflections on the benefits of blogging, including my personal story in my 100th post, so at first I thought I might not take up the challenge to respond to the Rockstar Meme – How Blogging Changed Your World in Gret’s latest post. I agree with much of what these guys say about it!   Instead I have decided to focus on a different blog this time. It’s a collaborative blog called Inquire Within, which is dedicated to inquiry in the broadest sense. Anyone can join and participants can contribute as frequently or occasionally as they like. Cross posts are welcome, as is linking to other blogs. It’s an unpretentious, non-judgemental space for discussing anything related to inquiry and for sharing ideas and practice. So far there are contributors from twelve countries across six continents. Here’s what I have got out of it so far…  I’m tagging  Clive, Michael, Ellen, Maggie and Cristina  because they live in different parts of the world, because they have each enriched my learning in different ways and because I know they have interesting and varied stories to share."

        "text": "While I’m still new in the blogsphere (not even 6 months under my belt yet!) I can certainly attest to what you and both men are saying… blogging does change your life!  Just as twitter changed my whole idea of professional development, blogging has completely changed my idea of what reflective practice means.  I find that I blog for the release, the catharsis of getting the ideas and the words out of my head more than anything else.  I love to look back when I finish a post and think “wow, I wrote that. Now, what does it mean to me? How can I use it to move me forward?”.  While I do enjoy receiving comments and other feedback, as Gret and the others you tagged are sure to agree with, it is for personal growth that motivates me the most.  (making friendship, seeing new perspectives, etc.)Thank you for always sharing your journey with us and as you mentioned, you have enriched MY learning in different ways with the wonderful stories and outlooks that you share!"

Your enthusiasm for learning (via twitter and your blog) is infectious!I often thank the friend who encouraged me to blog, as I had no idea what a difference it would make. Not only has it opened up the world and led me to interesting educators all over the world, but it’s helped me clarify my thinking on so many issues. (Like you, I write as much for myself as anyone else!). Do you think in blogposts? 🙂 I often find myself in situations (workshops, meetings, classrooms…) involuntarily summarising, synthesising or analysing in a blog post in my head!Ed"

        "text": "Hi Edna,I’ve had an amazing journey reading through your posts both past and present and the Inquire Within blog is a fantastic insight into inquiry education and other teachers’ experiences.The Inquire Within blog actually reminds me of my favorite part of attending IB workshops (especially the international ones). It’s meeting teachers from other schools and countries and all with different perspectives, interpretations, and stories about inquiry and the IB experience. Many of other these interactions and experiences have changed who I am as an educator. The only downside was that I could only experience it once a year, twice if I was lucky. Now with your blog, your unstoppable twitter feed, Inquire Within blog and the countless leads, links and referrals to other amazing people… I’m almost afraid of what all this information and insight might do to me…You’re the friend that inspired me to start… and I thank you.By the way I mentioned you in my first blog post (a working progress)  and added a little quote that reminds me of your contribution to the education blogging world http://erwindumenden.edublogs.orgErwin"
