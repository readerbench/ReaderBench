        "text": " I read Dale Worsley’s post this morning and thought about how lucky I am to work in a primary school with a dynamic learning culture, where passionate teachers constantly seek the most engaging and meaningful ways for their young learners to take ownership of their learning, where the learning is for ‘now’ AND for the kind of future in which they will live and learn. I recently received this email from a friend whose daughter has just started High School (She’s 12. In Australia, children move from Primary School directly to High School. We don’t have Middle School as a separate stage). My daughter’s education to date has been nothing short of remarkable. She has soaked up and been enticed by all that the school has to offer. She has inquired and pushed boundaries. She has investigated and wondered her way through the most intriguing PYP journey. She is a thinker and has loved being knee deep in creative expression and pondering units of inquiry that encouraged her to be open minded and inquire into things she wonders about. With amazing guidance, she whole heartedly explored her area of passion and with excitement and exuberance presented her findings at the Year 6 exhibition. Now in year 7, her school bag is full of thick text books (which also sit on her iPad) which travel to and from school. She sits at night working through pages of maths problems from the text books. Just as I had done when I was in high school (a million years ago) … A little archaic. I understand it is very early days yet, but where has that amazing transformative thinking gone? The creative learning that is so full of colour and excitement… Please tell me Ed, that it is on its way???? My sad reply: ‘I cant’ And again I wonder about the great divide between primary schools and (many) high schools…    A thoughtful response by @alohalavina – Crossing the Great Divide"

        "text": "The divide is a scary one for secondary teachers and even more so for administrators who either dont/wont recognise the divide or dont know where to begin to bridge the gap (NB: I am generalising, I work with some great Sec teachers who engage and get Ss to inquire). Secondary teachers often hit the fail safe button excuse for dishing out content- exams, the universities need scores, the IBDP results etc….when in fact once you unlock the passion of learning and develop thinking skills the ‘content’ becomes much easier to engage, make sense of and be critical of. I often hear Sec teachers talk about scores and not about the learning.  Of course what do universities do? In undergrad it seems to be content based, write the exam, pass take another unit then repeat. Then we get to Masters or Doctorate where now we are expected to think critically again and our inquisitive nature has been so numb for so long from being ‘schooled’ its very hard! The shift in the divide needs to come from Universities/Colleges and they need to recognise other ways of assessing and evaluating learners. of course this requires more hard work and deep though. Content will remain king."

        "text": "One of the more significant issues holding Secondary teachers back (speaking as one – and I try to push the boundaries fairly often) is the entire idea that we’re preparing students for University. The roll-down impact of this is that we feel the need to prepare kids to a) get into uni (tests, content, etc), b) be able to sit through lectures and c) deliver syllabi that have been created to suit universities rather than the kids 9 times out of 10. We also have parents who, while not as directly involved as they are in Primary, see anything that diverts from the path as being a “waste of time” regardless of the learning and thinking skills that go on in those activities. Essentially, we’re caught between a rock and a hard place, with few ways of expressing our creative and innovative practices and still meeting all those other goals. Having said all that, there are bright lights in the distance – I have staff who value the learning and thinking as highly as the content (as we all should) and are trying all sorts of different things in their classes. Also – there’s no excuse for kids to be carrying around textbooks and writing out heaps of homework in the dog-tired old school manner when they’re in a school that has obviously moved into a technologically integrated curriculum."

We’ll be switching schools next year to one with MYP and hopes that her “I love learning about..” will come back.  As a PYP primary school teacher, we focus on educating students for life, not for exams.  It is time for secondary education to also have a hard look at what’s important and worth learning in school.

The school I am in now is the most advanced for Middle Years that I have experienced, as they are now following a self-made Middle Years curriculum based on skills and core competencies. This is however the exception rather than the rule in my experience. The story of your friend’s daughter is all too familiar. It seems increasingly clear to me, after 25 years in teaching, that Primary school teachers tend to be more focussed on pedagogy and Secondary teachers, on subject content. I think this comes with being specialists in a particular subject as you do also see the same subject content focus sometimes with Language teachers (even in Primary). Alternatively, maybe it is due to the external pressures of exams."

        "text": "Thanks for posting this, Ed. It would make for a good continuum chat. As an MYPCo and HS teacher, I’m on a mission to switch the grades-focus of students and teachers as much as I can. It is very difficult, especially as kids get older and the stakes of university entry (and the intense backwash it creates) kick in. But we can inquire in meaningful ways in HS and as we chip away we see the students expect a different experience. Lectures and tests eventually don’t cut it anymore. GPA’s never help. Key to inquiry across the divide is understanding its definitions and helping others see how we can value inquiry and engaged learning in order to build enthusiasm and curiosity for learning the ‘canon’ of stuff that makes up these exams. MYP:NC makes this much easier to sell and is a more operable (and less ‘alien’) framework for teachers new to all of the great elements of an IB education in the MS-HS. Sometimes I have to remember that teachers come into the IB systems from all sorts of backgrounds, some of which are generations’ worth of terrible – restrictive syllabus, test-driven assessment, high-stakes outcomes (driven by league tables), %-based grading (ugh), high-homework, low-service. Fear can drive a lot of creativity out of otherwise passionate people. We have to help them get it back."

It inspired me so much that I had to write a reply! http://myptoolbox.com/2015/02/21/crossing-the-great-divide-through-inquiry/As a MYP and DP teacher, I’ve used inquiry approaches in my Language and literature classroom, and it was a matter of changing the process of learning, the pedagogy, more than anything. It is a challenging change, especially when one has the pressure of exams and results. I think of exam performance as by-products of engaged, personally meaningful learning, which can be achieved through inquiry approaches. http://myptoolbox.com/2015/02/22/inquiry-in-a-secondary-school-classroom/ is another post inspired by your reflective post. Many thanks for provoking thought on what it means to make our students partners in learning and to structure learning in ways that allow multiple entry points rather than a single receptive and productive response."

I wrote a piece comparing the two contexts a while back (http://readwriterespond.com/?p=86). What concerns me is that the push of ‘exams’ is going deeper and deeper into Primary school. There are far too many sausage factories, as Yong Zhao would put it, for my own liking. Not exactly sure of the answer, but it is a problem that needs to be resolved. When, I am not sure. I think that one step is in highlighting those Secondary schools/teachers who are working against the grain and celebrate the small successes."
