        "text": " Whether it ignites an inquiry or shifts the gears of learning, if itâ€™s fuelled by careful consideration and clear intentions, a â€˜provocationâ€˜ can drive powerful learning.  Considering the â€˜power of provocationsâ€™ with our Lana Fleiszig recently, teachers exploredÂ the purpose of provocations, what could be used as provocation andÂ the teacherâ€™s role in the provocation process. The most important question, though, is what might the provocation reveal about our learners, their thinking and learning and where to next? Our teachers collaboratively developed a list of questions to consider when designing provocations: Weâ€™re looking forward to taking it further in the coming â€˜ Revealâ€™ workshop with Sam Sherratt exploring â€˜what it means toÂ be aware of, receptive to and curious about what our students are revealing to us so that we can be constantly inquiring into our students and adjusting our planning accordingly.â€™  Do you begin with a purposeful provocation and then planÂ in response to learning?"

        "text": "Hi Edna,Thank you for sharing these questions. They will certainly be useful when planning/adapting our provocations in the future. I believe that I need to put more thought into provocations and use them to better effect next year. It has become a self-given target.In a recent workshop with Tania Lattanzio, she suggested using provocations to give students experiences of complex concepts (that are often tricky to define). This connects to more than one of your questions. You might be interested in this recent post from me: Silent Teacher Day â€“ Mr. Hillâ€™s Musingshttps://mrhillmusings.wordpress.com/2017/05/28/silent-teacher-day/ I believe that the provocation was a success. Using your list, I have even more confidence in it because it achieved many of the aims that you have identified. This was just one example. I would now like to develop others that are equally powerful.Thanks again!Adam"

        "text": "Hi AdamItâ€™s  interesting to think about. Clearly using a provocation can be a good way into the learning, if teachers see its value in dictating where to go next, rather than just moving on to other preplanned activities. Sounds like yours was a powerful one! I think we need to remember that sometimes a really simple provocation can be effective too ðŸ™‚"
