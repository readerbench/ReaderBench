        "text": " In a recent post, I reflected on how my beliefs about teaching and learning have changed, using the thinking routine â€˜I used to thinkâ€¦ Now I think...â€™ Another challenging thinking routine from Project Zero is 3-2-1 Bridge, which like the previous one,Â reveals the development of thinking over time. Â Students express their initial thoughts, questions and ideas about a topic, then later make connections with their new thinking, after further learning has taken place.  Hereâ€™s my thinking on the subject of Twitter, using this routineâ€¦ (Note: If youâ€™re new to the whole Twitter idea, start by readingÂ  this post instead) BEFORE Thoughts: Questions: Analogy: AFTER Thoughts: Questions: Analogy: BRIDGE (What caused the shift in thinking?) And I could go on and onâ€¦ Hereâ€™s my first post about Twitter from November last year. Â I had already begun to see the value at that pointâ€¦ and Iâ€™ve come a long way since! My intention was to use Twitter as an example to apply the 3-2-1 Bridge routine. Â I seem to have got a bit carried away ðŸ™‚ â€¦ Clearly I am highly enthused by the PLN with whom I have connected through Twitter! Unplanned series ofÂ posts based on Project Zero Thinking Routines #4  "

I guess we have now both sifted out the rubbish and found those gems â€“ every day I get inspired by brilliant educators around the world who generously share their ideas.  This has been a tough year for me, moving from Asia back to Europe and it is the contacts and conversations with the members of my PLN who have encouraged me to move forward and make a difference here in my new school.  Thanks!"

You have always listened and learned and now you are sharing that in a beautiful way. You donâ€™t teach a subject, you teach people- and your students appreciate that and shine."

Once again, a fabulous post that has me thinking about my own thinking (oh yeah, and how to use these thinking routines with students).  Thank you!"

I started using the routine â€˜ I used to think but now I think â€˜ with Preps and decided to use the 321 in our next unit. I love the routines and the opportunity to make our learning visible. I am now a fan and look forward to reading your blog on a regular basis."
