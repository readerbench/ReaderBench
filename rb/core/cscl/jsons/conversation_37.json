        "text": " Following on from our  non-linear consideration of curriculum, we approached collaborative unit planning in a similarly holistic way, with the child at the centre, to ensure a focus on our goal of developing the whole child. As teachers considered the desired conceptual understandings and the content requirements of our curriculum, the potential to develop skills and dispositions in an authentic context were revealed…   Following this process with different year level teams and different units of inquiry led to a number of insights: (*we use ‘dispositions’ rather than ‘attitudes’ now.)"

        "text": "I like this more iterative, visual planning model. I also appreciate that you acknowledge planning before, during and after teaching and learning. I am at the stage of wanting to put aside the term ‘planning’ and talk more about ‘documenting’ teaching and learning. The word planning suggests that it is done before the teaching and learning ever happens, and we know that this is not conducive to authentic inquiry."
