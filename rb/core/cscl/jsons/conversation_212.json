        "text": " What is digital citizenship? Thatâ€™s the driving question behind our current Year 5 unit of inquiry. Itâ€™s the start of the school year here in Australia, so the unit begins with the establishment of a learning community in the classroom. Students will explore what citizenship comprises in the context of the class community, â€˜a sense of belonging, rights and responsibilities, duties and privileges, agreed values and mutual obligations required for active participation in the group.â€™ (Australian Civics and Citizenship Curriculum) From there, it should be an easy jump to considering digital citizenship, through the conceptual lenses of responsibility , reflection and connection. Our learners will explore these questionsâ€¦ Weâ€™re hoping to help connect our learners with other learners, both locally and globally and, in the process, develop and consolidate these understandingsâ€¦ The Year 5s would like to hear from teachers and classes interested in collaborating via Skype, blogs, Twitter, Voicethread, email or other media they have not yet thought of. They are keen to connect with classes anywhere who are eagerÂ to broaden their horizons, collaborate on an inquiry into digital citizenship or simply share and compare learning. Theyâ€™re looking for once-off as well as ongoing collaborations.  Are you interested? Submit "

So far we have looked at our responsibilities online. We have used a lot of ideas from http://www.commonsensemedia.com. Here are some of the things we have been exploring: We have been using twitter to learn about networks. Our class twitter account is @LCSGrade4A and @LCSGrade4B. We have looked a bit at cyberbullying and today we discussed our digital footprint. On Fridays has been BYOD Fridays, in which the kids can bring their own web-enabled devices. And we have just finished a week of clusters in which kids chose one out of 6 areas to explore about digital media and how to use it responsibly and how it is used to connect with other people. We would love to share ideas with you."

I am in Educational Media 310 or EDM 310 and we are learning to be digital citizens through blogging and podcasting.  So far I have learned many valuable skills and how to be aware of what I put on the internet.  As a future teacher I plan to use these methods in my own classroom.

As the teacher librarian/information literacy specialist, Iâ€™m starting the year with Year 3/4 looking at exactly the same ideas as you.  We started out with a discussion about the power that the Internet (or a networked society) gives us and how it makes us feel (inspired by a Common Sense Media lesson).  Weâ€™re recording our thinking on padlet.com (formerly known as wallwisher) for the time being.  Please have the Year 5 teachers get in contact so we can get some sharing happening!Beth"
