        "text": " What is creativity? Can anyone be creative? What are the conditions for creativity? Can creativity be taught? Can/should creativity be assessed? How might we encourage childrenâ€™s (and teachersâ€™) creative instincts? How do we create opportunities for creativity in our classrooms? Is teaching creatively the same as teaching creativity? Is creativity an attitude, a skill, a conceptual lens or is it action? (PYP connection) What is the relationship between inquiry learning and creativity? How might global collaborations Â enhance creativity? These are some of the big questions with which participants grappled in aÂ PYP workshop on encouraging creativity, last week at Victorious KidssÂ Educares, an international school in Pune. It was the first time I had led this workshop and I wanted to ensure that the teachersâ€™ own creativity was awakened and that the workshop would provide opportunities for creative thinking and creative expression. In addition to exploring the issues above, among other things, teachers designed creativity maps..   recorded their thinking on wall mounted â€˜bubble catchersâ€˜â€¦   engaged in a newspaper bridge building challengeâ€¦   audited their units for opportunities for creativityâ€¦ Skyped with teachers in Melbourne about creativity in the early years, in writing and in mathsâ€¦  planned andÂ created animations...   Hope they had as much fun as I did ðŸ™‚"
