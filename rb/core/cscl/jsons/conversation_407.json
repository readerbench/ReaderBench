        "text": " Isidore Isaac Rabi, winner of a Nobel Prize for physics, when asked why he became a scientist, replied, “My mother made me a scientist without ever knowing it. Every other child would come back from school and be asked, ‘What did you learn today?’ But my mother used to say, ‘Izzy, did you ask a good question today?’ That made the difference. Asking good questions made me into a scientist.” I’ve been discussing inquiry with Jessica at Stars and clouds. We both work in PYP schools, where inquiry underpins all teaching and learning. We’re continuously looking for ways  to strengthen inquiry and to make it more student driven. Our conversation is about how to get learners asking questions, so that the inquiry is theirs, rather than teacher directed. This week’s #edchat tackled a similar issue and educators around the world shared their ideas about (and obstacles in) student directed learning. Inquiry encourages students to be actively involved in and to take responsibility for their own learning. Inquiry learning allows each student’s understanding of the world to develop in a manner and at a rate  unique to that student. The starting point is students’ current understanding, and the goal is the active construction of meaning through: Here’s my take on it… By whatedsaid | View this Toon at ToonDoo | Create your own Toon The more we plan, the more teacher directed it becomes. If we have a very detailed idea in advance of where the lesson (or the unit or the semester) will go then it’s not  inquiry. What we do need to plan is really strong provocations to get students engaged in the big ideas, so that they’ll be motivated to question, wonder, inquire, explore… and learn. Still thinking…  please join me.  "

        "text": "So interesting. BTW,  i luv the cartoon.My thought is that eliciting questions is critical, but it really works best when the teacher/mentor/coach has a very clear idea of the path they want the student to take. Curiosity is a natural human behavior.  There is no longer any doubt in my mind that the organization of Time, Space and Authority in many of the ineffective schools mitigate against that natural behavior.But once that hurdle has begun to be overcome, it highlights the need for a very clear path in the teacher’s mind. to the student it’s invisible. To me that magic of of great teaching is a bit like the magic performed by a great healer. It seems that the teacher is doing nothing. In fact, without the sure guidance of hyper awareness it may be fun. And engaging. But it’s not the learning that we know these kids need."

In the PYP, for instance, each unit has an enduring central idea, essential questions and pre-selected key concepts that guide the inquiry.

That the questions had to come from them. They were a bunch of serious inquirers, curious and open-minded and always up for a challenge. They were 8, 9 and 10 years old, although I don’t think this should matter, because we start our lives with asking a lot of questions that are meaningful to us.I would like to try this again. YOU ask the questions. I probably haven’t made it so explicit. And then, at the end of the day, we could reflect, asking ourselves “Did you ask a good question today?” I will think about the rest a bit more,…. I feel a blog post coming up too!"

Before around middle school it’s not that much of a problem for most students as they have less invested in being the person that is just right.

        "text": "To Layla ,Thanks for your comment. I think teachers who “get it” need to refocus their energy from trying to convince those who still don’t, towards making it work for their students in their classrooms and schools. Nothing will change attitudes faster than success. Not in terms defined by most educrats and politicians, but in terms that we understand. An under appreciated fact is that the rate of educational innovation has been faster than at any time in human history. Bringing billions of people on the planet into the liberation of literacy is epoch changing. In richer countries, the new ways of applying well understood principles of learning – Dewey, Piaget and others in that tradition,  are growing faster than ever. Education as timely evidence and experienced based interventions to clear a student’s path to knowledge are only now practical because of the nearly ubiquitous connection to essentially free telecommunications in voice, words and video.Gibson said “The Future is Here. Just unevenly distributed.” Important to keep in mind that Google is only 12 years old. Now with smartphones, iPads, and other mobile connections the last piece for the most fortunate is in place.  To get to reliable communication with those less fortunate, I’m pretty sure it will need Print. But that’s another story.In any case, if the word of the new ways of teaching got to the public at large, instead of being focused on convincing other teachers, the whole thing could get from here to there much faster."

Our school is a candidate school for the PYP and this is our first year trying to implement the model/framework. I am a little bit worried that the PYP framework will not allow as much free inquiry as I would like to see but your post today came at the right time: yes, we need to make sure we provoke in our students the need to question. They were doing it constantly when they were 3 or 4 years old and now, even at just 6 years old they seem to have lost some of that sense of wonder. On Monday I will start a poster on which we will post all the questions that the students are asking. I think I will divide the poster in two: questions that require inquiry and questions that are facts; this way i hope the students will begin to understand the difference between the two kinds of questioning. I am just brainstorming out loud here but that’s what I do every time I read one of your inspiring posts. Thank you."
