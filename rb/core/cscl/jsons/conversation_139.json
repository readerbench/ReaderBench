We begin by surveying the teacher-learners to find out what sort of learning opportunities they would prefer. The results indicate theyâ€™d like a combination of time to pursue their own interests independently and facilitated workshops addressing relevant topics of their choice. So, our student- free day next Monday will look like this- Session1 â€“ Teachmeet. In the traditional Teachmeet style, teachers will present for 2 or 7 minutes, sharing a tool, a strategy, an idea or an example of practice. Without the need for coercion, we have volunteers from every single grade level (and several from some!) on a range of topics, such as: Session 2 â€“ Workshops Teachers choose to facilitate and/or participate in two out of eight one-hour workshops on topics of interest, identified through the survey. Workshops will be hands on, encouraging active group participation and opportunities for participants to construct meaning for themselves, on the following topics: Session 3 â€“ Personal learningÂ  Teachers choose to collaborate in teams or work individually on anything they like. For many, this is a continuation of previous personal learning time but some have chosen new areas for inquiry and others will use the time to apply their learning from the morning sessions.Â Ideas are as diverse as: As always, we have dismissed the notion that one size fits all, and ensured that our learning principles underpin, not just student learning at our school, but our own professional learning too. Our learning principles â€“ Weâ€™ll ask everyone to reflect at the end of day, not just on what they have learned, but on what they notice about themselves as learners and on the process of learning itself. If youâ€™re in Melbourne and excited by the potential to be a part of this vibrant learning community, see my previous post."

        "text": "I hope your day runs as fantastically as it sounds. I could happily have one of these days a fortnight given the rate of change in my practice at the moment! Iâ€™m excited by how the way I teach is constantly being challenged with regular practice analysis conversations, on-going subject specific PD blending inquiry practices and 21st century thinking ideas etc but itâ€™s mostly after school and most of my personal inquiry is late at night or carved out of my weekend and holidays. Days like this really value and give teachers what they are so lacking in â€“ time to think. (Our school system doesnâ€™t give teachers free periods during the day as I know many do.)Coincidentally this idea connects to some other blog surfing Iâ€™ve been doing today; a conversation that had resulted from a tweet from someone undergoing a one size fits all session PD session. How you are structuring your day is pretty much exactly the suggested improvements. A teacher self-led or small group idea had really spoken to me, so it was exciting to see your session 3 idea.What I love about this kind of PD structure is that it much better matches the exciting and empowering learning opportunities our students are offered. Also as you mention there is such a wealth of in-school expertise so it is wonderful to see it being publicly valued."
