Critical thinking We need to build a culture of thinking, starting from day one so that learners know they’re in an environment where thinking is valued. 3. Inquiry It’s not a lesson, it’s a stance. It involves letting go of control and giving kids an opportunity to explore, wonder, question and experiment. 4. Collaboration If students are expected to sit  in lines facing the front and listen to the teacher most of the time, they won’t suddenly know how to collaborate for ‘group work’ on Monday in period 6. 5. Values It’s who you are, what you model, what you expect. All the time. 6. Art Okay, so you should teach art on Monday period 6, but using art across other disciplines adds another layer to learning. Examine paintings of historical events. Use artifacts and paintings to provoke thinking. 7. Language   We use language to think and communicate. It’s fundamental to learning across the curriculum.  8.  Literacy   ‘Literacy is the ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate and compute, using printed and written materials associated with varying contexts.’ (UNESCO) 9. Study Skills I didn’t even know this one had  been considered a subject in some schools! Surely learning about how to learn is vital across all areas? (Thanks @olafelch) 10. This one’s yours… What do you think? "

It might start with teacher schools pushing technology into their content.  Perhaps the next generation of teachers will be comfortable enough with tech to use it in content.  If I were to run a school, I wouldn’t have a tech class.  I would only hire teachers with that level of comfort.—As for study skills, I teach a middle school course called AVID which basically teaches students how to be a student: organizing, studying, note taking, being in class.  It’s a great course and badly needed for our students who haven’t be taught how to do school."

My problem with integrating so much technology into the classroom is that kids nowadays do not seem to socialize like when I was growing up.  I understand that today kids have grown up texting, emailing, and blogging.  Now walk up to one of these kids who are  texting their friends and ask them a question, point blank, and watch how socially inept they are, one on one.  I believe that technology does have a place in school, but, when your teachers are spending all of their time training to use the tech, when do they actually teach?  When your kids cannot answer a simple question face to face, but can text you an in depth response then how has technology helped?  Where have all of the basic social skills gone?  Maybe that should be taught in period 6."

        "text": "Though I agree with the idea that many subjects should not be taught exclusively in isolation, I do believe that it is beneficial to teach certain subjects “Monday in period 6”, but then practice, expand upon, and integrate those subjects into all aspects of learning.  Though I can integrate famous artists and their masterpieces into a history (or other) lesson, I cannot actually teach the children how to do an impressionist painting.  Though I sing in my classroom, and incorporate song in my lessons, I cannot demonstrate proper pitch.  To me, eliminating technology specialists would be like eliminating all reading or math specialists or other learning support teachers.  All teachers should be held to high standards, but we cannot be experts in all areas.  We should be part of a team, all working together to provide the best possible education to our students."
