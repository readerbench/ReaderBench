        "text": "  As a PYP school, our approach to learning is through inquiry.  It’s often challenging to make second-language learning inquiry based, and we teachers are always experimenting with different options. (We’re inquirers too!) Today’s task was simple.  Instead of giving a new Hebrew vocabulary list, with English translations, I gave the words in Hebrew only. Each group received different words and they swapped with another group when they had figured out the meanings.  I didn’t give any directions, just handed out dictionaries and asked them to work collaboratively to find out the meanings of as many words as possible. How did they work out the meanings of the words? The task was nothing special and I’m sure it was obvious to most.  But, as always, the most interesting aspect was the students’ reflections. (They are Year 5 students)"

        "text": "I agree, second language is often a difficult area for inquiry. I used to teach French, although it wasn’t an IB school. This is a simple, but effective, strategy to get students to do the thinking and inquiring themselves. Sometimes we overlook the simple things and try to make things more complex, so it’s great too see that this was such a success. Well done!"
