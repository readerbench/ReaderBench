        "text": " How best do little kids learn? It’s not a question generally asked by only slightly bigger kids!  A. is an unusual student (aren’t they all?) in Grade 2 with a passion for teaching and learning. His teacher understands him well and, rather than demanding compliance (not his forte), has tapped into his interests, encouraging him to explore possibilities by going down to teach the Prep children. Apparently he meets with the Prep teacher to understand their needs and discusses with his teacher his ideas for his lessons.  When Kath Murdoch visited the school, his teacher introduced A. and got Kath to explain the notion of inquiry learning. She’s working indirectly on helping him regulate his own learning through his understanding of learning in the bigger picture. Today I have the pleasure of spending half an hour with him, in my favourite pastime… educational dialogue! He tells me about his experience so far with the Preps and asks me about effective teaching and learning. I suggest he start by thinking about his own learning and the approach of his own teacher, whom he clearly admires. He opens his notebook and thoughtfully starts a list:  I show him some of our learning principles and he is instantly engaged. by these three:  ‘So… I need to get them curious’, he says, ‘and encourage them to be risk takers and try different things. They need to work together and talk to each other. And I need to make sure it is challenging… slightly bigger than where they start so they have to be extended and keep going…’. He pauses for a moment ‘And if not, it’s giving me a clue that the lesson might not be suitable or interesting’.  As A. starts copying from the cards, I tell him he can have the one he’s focusing on. He looks longingly at the rest of the pile and I encourage him to take them all. ‘They might help me further along’ he says and heads happily back to class, notebook in one hand, learning principles in the other… on a mission to explore how kids learn best. Just give kids the opportunity and encouragement… and magic happens."

        "text": "I love how student A was able to research/investigate/discuss/think over his interest in his own learning and consequently, his desire to teach others. How fortunate that his Year 2 teacher was sensitive to A’s specialness (and all the other students in his/her class, no doubt) and how A could explore his interest in learning skills and methods. I most loved visualising how A wanted to take all the printed out statements with him!!! I want to be HIS student!!!!"
