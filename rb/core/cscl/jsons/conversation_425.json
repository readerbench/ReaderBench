Now I think they need to sit in groups, in order to collaborate and construct meaning together. 3. I used to think the classroom needed to be quiet and I needed to be in control. Now I think noisy lessons where the kids are engaged often reflect learning at its most vibrant. 4. I used to think silence had to be filled by repeating the question or asking a different question. Now I think silence means every student has enough time to think. 5. I used to think differentiation meant setting different tasks for different abilities. Now I think digital tools often ¬†provide natural differentiation for different levels, abilities and interests. 6. I used to think every student had to put up his hand before he spoke and all conversation had to go through me. Now I think the best discussions are ones where the kids are responding to each other and I‚Äôm out of the picture. 7. I used to think that praising kids was necessary positive reinforcement. Now I think that feedback needs to be constructive and specific and praise on its own isn‚Äôt helpful. 8. I used to think exercise books had to be neat, with a margin drawn at the side. Now I think exercise books are for thinking, reflecting, scribbling ideas and working things out, so it doesn‚Äôt matter what they look like. 9. I used to think finished work should be hung on the wall so the class could see it. Now I think the best place for samples of learning is on the class blog or wiki where an authentic audience can read/listen and comment. 10. I used to think that assessment was to find out whether students had mastered a topic or a skill, and¬†took the form of tests for which I gave grades. Now I think assessment should inform teaching /learning and can occur through any learning experience, including listening to what students say. 11. I used to think PD was through conferences and workshops. Now I think some of¬†my best professional learning has been through Twitter and blogs. 12. I used to think the teacher was the teacher and the students were the learners. Now I think we‚Äôre all part of a community of learners‚Ä¶ Oops, there are 12 üòâ Please add your thinking to the list‚Ä¶ Series of¬†posts on ‚Äô10 Ways ‚Ä¶‚Äô #4 10 ways to encourage students to take responsibility for their learning 10 ways to foster a love of learning 10 ways to create a culture of thinking"

Those people need to do some drills and rote memorization.
