The relationship between teaching and learning, has and should be, interdependent.  I haven‚Äôt been in PD yet, but I have sat through enough bad presentations to want to avoid the top-down style of learning you mention. Blogs and twittering is a great way to expand your ideas and strategies beyond the confines of your school, community and country.  I did have a couple of buddies that I met on a teacher message board who used together once a month in starbucks to talk teaching strategies (I was social networking before the phrase was invented).Also blogging gives you a great portfolio to be able to show others when it comes time to account for your PD time which Brett mentions."

It is a real challenge to get teachers to understand that there is so much rich learning out there. They come to staff meeting with all of the stress and baggage of their work. How can I help to make professional learning something that everyone talks about and looks forward to? When are we going to start acting like professional learners?"

The first point you made about ‚Äúteachers taking responsibility for their own learning‚Äù is perfect. There is most definitely a cultural divide between the educators who believe PD should be done and given to them, versus the educators who want to take control and charge of their own growth and development. I find that some educators are similar to students‚Ä¶it is easier for them to sit back and let someone do all the thinking and planning for them. They say, ‚Äújust tell me what to learn and what I need to do‚Ä¶‚Äù Thank you for this great post Edna!"

When I look at your ‚Äúused to be‚Äù there is a lot of administrative influence.  I agree with you that teachers are to be responsible for their learning and that will simply lead to more meaningful Pro-d, and more mastery at our own craft.  Reading many blogs like yours is Pro-d!  That is where I like your last section of where to go and how to continue.Thanks for another good read.Bernie"

Some tenured teachers must be forced into coming to even pre-semester staff meetings (cozy by some standards, with a delicious buffet of brunch goodies, and even then they are not enticed!) by the bylaws of the union. Others who must compete every semester for their positions come to PD sessions only for the paper to add to their dossier. Only five teachers out of almost 100 use blogs. We have a long way to go. I imagine we are like you were 20 years ago‚Ä¶I am a mere substitute in my university for now, but a valued team player,and I promise that I will work my hardest to make my school look like your school. For now, I am teaching teacher-trainee courses, and helping to form a different form of PD.I loved your post."

However, I am an optimist, and believe that change must start from the top. If administrators and leaders in education will start presenting to teachers in the same way they want teachers to present to their students, we will see change. Students won‚Äôt ‚ÄúSit & Get‚Äù and neither will teachers. Teachers need this modeling, and with patience and persistence I think change will occur."
