        "text": " Iâ€™ve always been a reader. My parentsâ€™ house was full of books and, as a child, I read every Enid Blyton book I could get my hands on before graduating to other genres and authors. I still recall Mrs Whitesman, my Standard 4 teacher who read us â€˜The Incredible Journeyâ€™ and that I was one of the privileged ones sometimes permitted to read aloud to the class. Mrs Gordon, the school librarian (who once threw a book at me for being cheeky!) would read us extracts from new books to encourage us to read. I remember her personal suggestions of life-changing books, like â€˜Exodusâ€™ and â€˜Mila 18â€™ by Leon Urisâ€¦ In recent years, even with my family spread around the globe, many a conversation has included shared book discussions and recommendations. My mom and I would discuss what we were reading till almost the end of her 91 yearsâ€¦ Itâ€™s time to take a break from blogging over the summer, although itâ€™s very much winter here in snowy Boston, where we are spending time with our gorgeous grandson and his parents. Before we left, I downloaded half a dozen books and chose some paperbacks (I still love â€˜real booksâ€™ ) because the holidays are always a time for reading. I brought along â€˜A Country Too Farâ€™, writings on asylum seekers by well known Australian authors for my son and and have already started reading â€˜The Rebirth of Educationâ€™ by Lant Pritchett, which he bought for me. My grandson Shai is 4 months old and his â€˜libraryâ€™ includes â€˜Ten little Fingers and Ten Little Toesâ€™, one of my favourites by Mem Fox, and â€˜VERY Little Red Riding Hoodâ€™, which he appears to be enjoyingâ€¦  Happy holidays and thanks for reading the blog during the year. Iâ€™ll be back in 2014!"
