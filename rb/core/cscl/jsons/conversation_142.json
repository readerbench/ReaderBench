There are five new School in the Cloud labs in different settings in India, three in schools and the latest two in remote areas, where kids walk from the local villages to access the computers and interact with emediators, who we refer to as the ‘granny cloud‘. We’re not all grannies, many volunteers are male and age isn’t relevant!  There are currently not enough ‘grannies’ to meet the needs of the new centres. Would you like to… Are you willing to… To learn more about the granny cloud and register your interest, go to the School in the Cloud website and you can read about some of my experiences here, here and here. If interested, let me know and I can help you with the process, or simply sign up on the site.   "
