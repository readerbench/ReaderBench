        "text": " One of my favourite things in the PYP is collaborative planning. Six times a year, my colleague Layla or I meet with each grade level team to collaborate on planning units of inquiry. Â Facilitating such sessions can range from exciting to frustrating, depending on the team, the unit, the time and,Â particularly, the ability to frame and agree on the desired conceptual understandings that will underpin the inquiry. This week, I experimented with a different approach to tune teachers into the unit, establish common understanding and model good practice. The unit of inquiry: Year 2 â€“ Central Idea: Public places are organised to meet the needs of community. The opening taskÂ for teachers:Â (given one step at a time) Taniaâ€™s role was to document the learning. She took photos of the group collaborating,Â observed the participantsâ€™ interactions and recorded the things they said.  Taniaâ€™s observationsÂ along the way: Statements about the concept of place: What the teachers noticed about themselves as learners: Discussion aboutÂ how we could apply the aboveÂ in the classroom: Agreed understandings: Conclusions: Â "

The process followed ensures that there is a deeper understanding of the unit & the expected outcomes which leads to a more effective inquiry in the classroom for the students. Way to go! I will take the up the same process with our next unit â€“ how we organise ourselves. Thank you for sharing ðŸ™‚"
