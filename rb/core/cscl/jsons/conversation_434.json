        "text": " 1. Don’t make all the decisions Allow choice. Encourage students to make decisions about how they learn best. Create opportunities for them to pursue their own interests and practise skills in a variety of ways.  Cater for different learning styles. Don’t expect everyone to respond in the same way. Integrate technology to encourage creative expression of learning. 2. Don’t play guess what’s in my head Ask open-ended questions, with plenty of possible answers which lead to further questions.   Acknowledge all responses equally. Use Thinking Routines to provide a framework for students to engage with new learning by making connections, thinking critically and exploring possibilities. 3. Talk less Minimise standing out front and talking at them.  Don’t have rows of learners facing the front of the class.  Arrange the seats so that students can communicate, think together, share ideas and construct meaning by discussing and collaborating. Every exchange doesn’t need to go through the teacher or get the teacher’s approval, encourage students to respond directly to each other. 4. Model behaviors and attitudes that promote learning. Talk about your own learning. Be an inquirer. Make your thinking process explicit. Be an active participant in the learning community. Model and encourage enthusiasm, open-mindedness, curiosity and reflection.  Show that you value initiative above compliance. 5. Ask for feedback Get your students to write down what they learned, whether they enjoyed a particular learning experience, what helped their learning, what hindered their learning and what might help them next time. Use a Thinking Routine like ‘Connect, extend, challenge’. Take notice of what they write and build learning experiences based on it. 6. Test less Record student thinking and track development over time. Provide opportunities for applying learning in a variety of ways. Create meaningful assessment tasks that  allow transfer of learning to other contexts. Have students publish expressions of their learning on the internet for an authentic audience. Place as much value on process and progress as on the final product. 7.  Encourage goal setting and reflection. Help students to define goals for their learning. Provide opportunities for ongoing self-evaluation and reflection. Provide constructive, specific feedback.   Student blogs are great tools for reflecting on learning and responding to their peers. 8. Don’t over plan. If you know exactly where the lesson is leading and what you want the kids to think, then you‘re controlling the learning. Plan a strong provocation that will ‘invite the students in’ and get them excited to explore the topic further. But don’t  plan in too much detail where it will go from there. 9.  Focus on learning, not work. Make sure you and your students know the reason for every learning experience. Don’t give ‘busy work’. Avoid worksheets where possible. Don’t start by planning activities, start with the ‘why‘ and then develop learning experiences which will support independent learning.  Include appropriate tech tools to support the learning. 10.  Organise student led conferences Rather than reporting to parents about their children’s learning, have student led 3-way conferences, with teacher and parents. The student talks about her strengths and weaknesses, how her learning has progressed and areas for improvement. She can share the process and the product of her learning. I  know there are lots more ways. Please add to the list! "

We both love it when they teach me stuff (which happens often)I love the rest of your list too – cant think how to make it better at this stage.Thanks again"

You have to follow it up next class of course. The sense of achievement kids get when they have the Eureka moment (when they DO reinvent the wheel) is really profound and it then gives them the confidence to become challenging learners.And in response to 4.

Let the kids know that you are human too – and ask them to help you solve the problem, or get it better the next time.In maths, I sometimes have a ‘virtual student’ – little Johnny – who always gets it wrong. I ask my students to explain to ‘little Johnny’ why he is making errors and how he can get it right the next time. A ‘kids teaching kids’ approach has been really successful for me."

        "text": "I think that #10 can also coincide with student evaluations as opposed to grades. I know the student can’t fully do their own evaluation, but I think evaluations will give students a better idea of those strengths and weaknesses, as opposed to, “I got a C in math because I’m not good at math/I didn’t do the homework.” I feel vague answers like that will definitely come from letter grade explanations. They have actually – I’ve seen myself, my younger brother, and my peers and many students do it all the time, because grades are vague.Anyway, to add to the list: Students proposing and voting on group/individual projects related to subject material. Also, allowing certain students the opportunity to explore topics further with reading, summaries/essays, a self-made film, or whatever they choose. This can allow students to exercise more freedom and participatory democracy, as well as gain intrinsic motivation to learn, because they have a personal say and stake in what they are doing. And often times (even on standardized tests!) I’ve wanted to read more about something, or do an essay or something, but have been made to move on just to keep up (relatively) to the rest of the group."

We talked about what successful learners in each subject did and made lists of those things.  Then out of those lists, the students pulled a few strengths from those lists that they believed they were doing.  Then they pulled a weakness from those lists-something they could try to do better.  Parent-student-teacher conferences provided a place for those 4th graders to have real conversations about their learning in the classroom.  The after-affect was the best part!  They referred back to the weaknesses, strengths, and goals they made on a weekly basis to see how they were doing!"

One of the strategies i use in class is chalk talk. This enables even the silent child to contribute. Questions like what makes you say that? are pretty effective. It  helps students describe what they see or know and asks them to build explanations. It promotes evidential reasoning (evidence-based reasoning) and because it invites students to share their interpretations, it encourages students to understand alternatives and multiple perspectives."
