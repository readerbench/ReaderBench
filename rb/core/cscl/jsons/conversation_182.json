        "text": " I really like Chobani Greek yoghurt, but I am tired of the three or four flavours sold at my local supermarket. A bit of research further afield has revealed no less than twenty flavours available. Apparently, if customers request, my local supermarket might stock a bigger variety. My choice was limited by¬†what I was offered and what I knew. It reminds me of schools‚Ä¶ Parents‚Äò expectations and demands tend to be based on school as they know it, on impressions formed when they themselves went to school. They choose homework and grades for the same reasons that I chose mango or strawberry. I didn‚Äôt know what else there was. It‚Äôs up to us to show them other possibilities. Many teachers continue to teach the way they always have, because they haven‚Äôt tried the blueberry and have never been exposed to pomegranate. Their schools, like my supermarket, provide limited choice for professional learning and it hasn‚Äôt struck them that they can explore further afield. Have they tried requesting other options or initiating their own explorations? Most importantly‚Ä¶ How much choice do students have in their learning? Do they have opportunities to explore and discover what‚Äôs out there, follow their passions and direct their own learning? Or do they only get to choose between the options their teachers present, in the same way that I was limited by my local supermarket? Have they discovered the honey flavour? What do they think of the lemon? Have they considered mixing flavours? Can they make their own yoghurt? "

Giving children freedom to choose their own ‚Äúflavours‚Äù and optitions to mix flavours to make their own is liberating for teachers and learners.Parents really struggle with shift in power from teacher to learner but when the children start choosing their own mixes ‚Äì the results are delicious. The move from highly structured tuition and writing frameworks allows children to express themselves in ways that they never thought was possible."

In regards to Ian‚Äôs comment isn‚Äôt Mike, Mikey, or Michael lucky to be able to decide that he DOESN‚ÄôT like all the other flavours. Like you said Edna we should at least try to offer a little taste because lord help the student who ONLY gets raspberry. That‚Äôs why I hope Mike the teacher doesn‚Äôt only offer raspberry to his kids just because that‚Äôs the only flavour he likes. Great work Edna!"

We have an inquiry based curriculum for the most part where students are encouraged to ask their own questions on the topic and this has gone some way to providing student voice in curriculum construction. Taking it a little further we have now introduced I time where students get to choose their own topic ( we ask that they plan it and use some of the skills identified rough other studies but the topic is theirs). Some interesting feedback from students ‚Äì why hadn‚Äôt we done this earlier ‚Äì we introduced this in year 3 and 4 as a trial. giving curriculum time over to student based investigations is a risk it‚Äôs a process and so far so good."

        "text": "Omigosh, this is such perfect timing for me, too.I just started back to classroom teaching (with 1:1 iPads) after many years of trying to institute school culture change as a learning specialist. I felt certain that this was the opportunity to institute my ideas of student-centered learning since I would be able to work directly with students instead of trying to convince teachers. It has not been quite as easy as I hoped it would be, and I have had to answer to a lot of push-back from parents who are (wrongly) fearful that my philosophy about decisions such as grades, homework, student choice, blogging/writing equate to a lack of rigor. Not only am I having to constantly explain and defend myself to parents, but I am finding the students in 4th and 5th grades are already deeply impacted by a school-y, teacher-centered culture. They, too, need to be introduced to new flavors. Thank you for this post. It gives me a new perspective, and I will cling to this idea when I begin (as I sometimes do) to question myself in the face of being constantly questioned."
