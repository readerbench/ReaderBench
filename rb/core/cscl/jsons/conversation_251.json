        "text": " IB Workshop¬†Leader¬†Training Day #3 We spend the morning exploring concept driven curriculum, an area I have discussed before on this blog. I‚Äôve summarised Lynn Erickson‚Äôs ideas and I‚Äôve shared examples of concept driven learning in the classroom.  Today we sum up our understandings, distilling the essence via a Frayer‚Äôs model, which has us creating a definition of a concept, describing the characteristics, listing out examples and non-examples.  The rest of the day is devoted to a concept driven inquiry of our choice, into almost any aspect of Thai culture, via personal exploration of ¬†the Chiang Mai area and communication with local people. It‚Äôs¬†not a fact-finding mission, the focus is to be on the process. We spend some time in our groups deciding where to go,¬†what to explore, what conceptual lens to use, which inquiry model will suit our purpose and how we will go about our¬†inquiry‚Ä¶ and then we‚Äôre off on foot, bicycle or bus.  The presentations the next day are inspiring. You can see more examples here and here. Each group shares their discoveries and their challenges. Participants have realised that inquiry is not a linear process, and rarely even a cyclical one. The process moves back and forth between asking, investigating, reflecting, connecting, constructing meaning ‚Ä¶ Some groups find they are even shifting between more than one ‚Äòmodel‚Äô. ¬†This is true inquiry. It has no map, no set pattern and it can be messy. Some of the high school teachers in particular, less familiar with this kind of learning, admit to feeling a degree of discomfort. But it‚Äôs the kind of positive tension that leads to authentic learning.  People have learned a great deal today‚Ä¶ not just about Thai culture, but about inquiry, about concept driven learning, about working in groups with other strong, passionate people, about ourselves as learners and about the process of learning itself. Craig is wondering how he can adapt this process for his Grade 4 class. I‚Äôm wondering how to recreate it back at my school for the teachers! Perhaps gaining a deep understanding of inquiry learning involves experiencing ¬†it yourself‚Ä¶"

You have shared THE most potent form of professional learning available for helping teachers understand the nature of inquiry as a process.  I have had some very powerful experiences with groups of teachers where we have taken the ‚Äòbig idea‚Äô and spent time as adult learners immersing ourselves in an investigation as learners prior to planning for students.  It‚Äôs a rare treat‚Ä¶ but worth devoting a pupil-free day to experience.  We‚Äôve explored the diversity of Melbourne for a day,  danced in the CERES African village, talked to the Elephant keepers at the zoo‚Ä¶.all with the view to immersing ourselves both in the big idea AND the process of inquiry.  Works a treat every time.  Sounds like you‚Äôve had a great workshop."

It is such a powerful way to engage kids, and when they do connect, as they construct their own knowledge and understanding, you can see their sparkle of learning. As a WSL, I agree, this is also transferred to adult learning. I continue to love facilitating IB PYP workshops as adults, including myself,  inquire, construct and collaborate. As an experienced and ‚Äòmature‚Äô teacher, I still get inspired with the teaching and learning for this every changing world. I could go on, but enough for now. Keep the posts going."

Although they sometimes roll their eyes at me when I say that, it motivates them to continue and push forward to create new meaning and new learning. I also teach this unit in my grade 4 class and I am now starting to think how I could adjust what you have done here to my classroom.

I love the idea of having the teachers do it as well. This is a great way for students and teachers alike to open their minds to creativity and see where their questions can take them, to have an open way of thinking rather than the common structure. We watched a video for class this week by Sir Ken Robinson and one thing he said was, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not prepared to be wrong, you‚Äôll never come up with anything original.‚Äù I think this applies to this inquiry method because if we are wrong, then we can just continue to ask questions and see where it leads us.Courtney"
