So I loved the session yesterday in which my Grade 5 group in Phaltan (Maharashtra) connected with my Grade 6 group in Delhi, because I had accidentally double booked my sessions. Despite bandwidth issues, we managed a three-way connection, although I turned off my camera and only dipped in and out to observe now and again. The two groups sang and danced for each other, they communicated by texting as well as talking and a good time was had by all (or so I thought.)    Both groups exploring art last week (separately) Initially my impression of the big ideas from the session were: But at one point I got a text message from Phaltan saying ‘We want to talk to Edna Granny’ and later, Madhura, the coordinator, shared that when she looked in towards the end, the kids were getting bored because nothing was happening. So I need to add these messages: On reflection, watching the videos, I realise that when the Phaltan group became disengaged, the other group was searching for the music for their dance. So maybe I should add: Not a session goes by  with that doesn’t teach me something about the children, about their world, about learning or about myself.

I too understand that sometimes we must adjust our plans that we were going to teach.  Each child is different.  Everyone learns at their own rate.  Some children as stronger in one subject than another.  I do believe that learn is for some takes time.  I think it is absolutely amazing to teach children.  I have noticed that by just watch I too am learning something.  Each and everyday they are teaching me as I am teaching them.  Do you feel like the children are teaching you during the sessions?  How do you help the kids that are learning at a different rate than the others?"
