Yesterday I received a response and exchanged some promising emails with Suneeta. We have arranged to catch up on Skype this week to discuss further. I hope they accept me as a mediator as I would love to be involved in this project!  Here’s an extract from their wiki, describing what they do… Towards a new education for children  We know that:Groups of children (6-12 yeards old in groups of 4 or so), given unrestricted and unsupervised access to the Internet can learn almost anything on their own. It doesn’t matter who or where they are. We know this from 20 years of research, standing on the shoulders of Aurobindo, Piaget, Vygotsky and Montessori. This kind of learning is activated by questions, not answers. There will always be children in the world who, for some reason or the other, cannot pay for education. There will always be children in the world who, for some reason of the other, will not have an adequate education. Hypothesis:There will always be people in the world who are willing to mediate in children’s learning for, say, one hour a week, with no remuneration. Speculation:If we create ‘clouds’ of mediators and children on the Internet and an arrangement by which they can interact, we would have an alternative schooling. Action:In the last three years, we have created 12 Self Organised Learning Environments (SOLEs) in addition to the several hundred ‘hole in the wall’ computers that exist in India, Cambodia and several African countries.  There exists a cloud of mediators that have begun to interact with these SOLEs. The cloud is self organised and called a Self Organised Mediation Environment (SOME). The mediators interact with the children over Skype.   "

On our school network we have access to absolutely every social networking site EXCEPT for Skype.  We are missing out on huge learning opportunities by not allowing Skype.  Please keep us updated with your experiences as a moderator.  I would like to learn more!"
