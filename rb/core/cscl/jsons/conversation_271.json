Â And it was noticed still by those who were with her right near the end. They remember her graciousness, her hospitality, her dignity, her gentleness and her warmth. Â I probably inherited more of her stubbornness and determination. â€¦ Going through my parentsâ€™ papers brings history alive. Â An aged postcard from Lithuania. Â A slightly tattered marriage certificate.Â Old identity documents from several countries. Â Copies of forms filled in searching for missing relatives after the war. Childhood drawings by grandchildren now in their twenties and thirties.Â Certificates, articles, letters and photographs. Itâ€™s the end of an era."
