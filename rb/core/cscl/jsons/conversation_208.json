In our professional learning survey at the end of 2012, the vast majority of staff indicated that they would like to use¬†the coming PD day to work on personal learning choices, individually or in small groups. The guidelines given to staff across the three campuses of our primary school: Bear in mind that it is a professional learning ¬†day and hence should not be used for catching up on paper work! Over to YOU‚Ä¶ Your reflection will include something along these lines. The plans so far‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a great fan of the work of Sugata Mitra, regarding self organised learning‚Ä¶ for children. It‚Äôs quite interesting to note that, given a full day to organise and explore anything they like, there are some teachers who find themselves wondering what to do with their time‚Ä¶ As always, our professional learning day is based on the same learning principles on which we strive to base all teaching and learning in our school.¬† Once you‚Äôre clear what you believe about learning, it‚Äôs easy to build learning opportunities and experiences for learners of all ages. Given a day like ours, what would you choose to do?"

The biggest question as with teaching children is how to get the best or relevant topics for your most experienced teachers as well as the new teachers.  This is often a hard call as training together in a  large hall means that probably the average educator gets more than the two ends of the spectrum unless the development topic is focussed on them.  So I wholeheartedly agree with this idea as this allows personal development to happen within a structured and sound environment.  I hope it proves useful for you."

Your comment about teachers not being sure how to use the whole day to learn is a fascinating one and really does make me wonder what we have done in schools to mix up the learning process for teachers. I think adults need more opportunities like this to learn about a topic to for the sake of learning‚Ä¶ Thanks for sharing!"
