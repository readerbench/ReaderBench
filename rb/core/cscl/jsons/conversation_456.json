We recently acquired a set of iPod Touch for classroom use.Â  As a way to encourage innovation, the principal had offered a $5000 grant for each of 3 projects to enhance student learning.Â  We put in a submission for a set of iPods and were successful! They have just been set up and I decided to give them a try today. Â The Voice Memo app seemed like a great way to practise second language skills. Â  For a few dollars each, we have bought tiny microphones like the one in the picture. Â The task was to interview a partner in Hebrew, Â based on the current topic of study, incorporating newly learned vocabulary. The kids were extremely excited, very little explanation was required and they went off to their corners to record. Hereâ€™s what the students said: My observations:  "

One minute youâ€™re SO frustrated and saying you hate technology and the next you have a moment where you realise why you love technology! Iâ€™m glad itâ€™s not just me!Iâ€™m glad we have the resilience and belief in technology to ride through the bad times! Also nothing beats the thrill of solving a technology problem!My Grade Two students love using the iPod Touches, I only wish I had more! Enjoy using them!!Kathleen"

Students are turned on to learning with the iPods.  I now have parents supplying their own ipods for their children in grade 1&2. Excited teachers, excited students learning happens. Your journey begins, have fun and thanks for your post."

We have recorded our own stories and listened to them on the iPods as well. Students always give each other feedback. Weâ€™re always scouting around for free educational podcasts, too, especially video ones. Students love to watch them as a part of their studies. I like the microphone idea. Sounds quick.Thanks for sharing!"

They were so in their element and having a great time manipulating words, practicing math, and looking at constellations they didnâ€™t want to leave when the bell rang.If you are looking for some good free iPod Touch apps, I wrote a magazine last year with 100 of my favorites http://issuu.com/ktenkely/docs/ilearn_2Have fun!"
