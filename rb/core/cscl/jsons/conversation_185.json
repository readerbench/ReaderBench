        "text": " ‘It was great last year’…  ‘The kids loved it’…  ‘No need for change’…  ‘Why fix what isn’t broken?’ It’s exciting to note that we rarely hear these comments in our planning sessions any more! Change and growth are embedded in the way we plan for learning. We prefer to start afresh and reinvent, in light of our current understandings, new teams collaborating, different students… And every time we plan,  we try to ensure more opportunities for students to take ownership of the learning. Two years ago we had our first social justice conference for Year 6 students. The event grew from a random idea, blogged and picked up by a teacher on the other side of the world, who breathed life into the vision. We developed her ideas further and the conference was a great introduction to the PYP exhibition process. The aims were- Last year the Year 6 team improved the structure of the conference, adding time for the kids to reflect in small groups after each speaker and opportunities to express their learning creatively at the end of the day. While the conference was outstanding, with  kids choosing what sessions to attend and actively engaged in learning on the day, essentially it was still organised for them. This year, it’s obvious what needs upgrading. The kids need more ownership. So we’ve called for volunteers who will write to the speakers, organise groups, make programs, welcome and thank the speakers, take photographs, film, tweet, blog… and whatever else they decide! I’m on leave at the moment, but delighted to find emails such as these in my inbox this morning: My name is Jared and I am in Mrs B’s class and she told me that you were looking for volunteers to help with the conference next term. I would be very happy help with all the organizing that needs to be done. Jared I would love to volunteer to help organise anything. I enjoy writing so I could make a blog post about the speakers, and I am very organised so I can organise anything. I could make programs or welcome the speakers too. I don’t really mind, I’m just happy to help. Thank you. Liora Dear Morah Sackson, I am very interested in this project. Any jobs available will be fine for me! Thanks a million! David. Hi Morah Sackson, I would love to volunteer to be an organizer for the conference. If I could I would like to write messages to the speakers with information. Thanks, Taylor I would love to cooperate! I would love to do anything… I am passionate to help out! Mia I would like to volunteer to work at lunchtimes. I would like to help create the program if I can. I am a great organiser and I really enjoy when things are in place. Ellie Next year the kids can do the whole thing!"

They felt it was worthwhile because it was an opportunity to develop and apply skills, but more importantly, to own their learning. And it was fun!"

I’m sure lots more people will want to volunteer. I can’t wait; I think it will be so worthwhile. It will help our organization skills and our writing skills.
