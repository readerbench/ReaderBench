        "text": " What do you notice about Audri as a learner? We begin our Year 4 collaborative planning session with Audri… to generate thinking about the ways young learners own their learning, outside the classroom… The teachers notice and name his confidence, persistence, belief in himself, resourcefulness, curiosity, commitment, ownership of learning, enthusiasm, excitement... Layla wonders if Audri’s uniqueness and enthusiasm would be stifled in a traditional school setting. Jina responds that she is excited by the possibilities of creating such authentic learning opportunities in her classroom. Watching an extract from Guy Claxton on building learning power adds another layer to our conversation: He says the ‘The ability to learn is very learnable’… Some key questions which he asks: Important learning dispositions that have value for our learners in the ‘real’ world (beyond passivity, remembering, note taking and regurgitating, even if these might be useful in some contexts): Claxton says it is possible to strengthen all of these, even within the parameters of conventional classrooms. One of the major considerations is how we talk. Most teachers spend a great deal of time talking about ‘work’.  Shifting the focus to the process of learning, makes a huge difference. Back in our planning meeting, we talk about the importance of making thinking visible and the value of noticing and naming learning behaviours, raised in both Making Thinking Visible by Ron Ritchhart et al and Choice Words by Peter Johnston. (Both books are highly recommended.) The latter highlights the influence our language has on student learning. I particularly like examples like this one, which demonstrate the effect of a few well-chosen words… “What have you learned most recently as a reader?” …the teacher begins with ‘given’ information that is not up for discussion: a) the student is a reader, and b) readers learn things. The only question is, what has this particular reader learned? For a student to respond to this question, he or she has to review recent learnings. The opening question requires an answer that begins, “I learned. . . .” It insists on an agentive identity statement about reading and learning. At the same time, it creates a learning history, which is an antidote for students who think they are not good and have always been not good.” As I’ve frequently said in this space – We have learned that it’s more valuable to spend time building a deep understanding of what a unit of inquiry is about and deciding on conceptual understandings than on planning activities. A valuable tip we gleaned from Sam Sherratt  is to agree on one word that sums up the conceptual essence of the unit. In this case it is ‘ownership.’ Central idea – Taking ownership of learning empowers us. Conceptual understanding rubric – Responsibility I expect the teacher to tell me what to do and how to do it. I can describe some ways I am becoming more responsible for my own learning. I can explain the reasons behind my choices and decisions. Reflection I can’t explain why I am doing specific tasks. I don’t understand the difference between ‘work’ and ‘learning’. I can explain why I am doing specific tasks. I can identify the skills and attitudes I need or am using. I can decide which strategies to use in my learning and explain my choice. I reflect on my learning, set learning goals based on my reflections, and act on them. I can explain how I could use my learning in different contexts. I can explain what I gained from a learning experience, what I contributed, what could have made it better. Feedback welcome!"

        "text": "Learning is certainly learn-able and so is the inability to learn. Much depends on understanding how our learning environment impacts on our ability to learn. We create “learning maps”, what we think we can learn and what we think we cannot learn based on our learning experiences. Challenging these learning maps helps us move forward and become life long learners.  My work is about learning how to manage (taking ownership) your learning environment to meet your learning needs and is called “Learning Intelligence” or LQ. There are a number of skills, attitudes, attributes and behaviours that form LQ, like the dispositions mentioned here, and all can be developed and in some cases re-written. here is my info graphic on LQ: https://magic.piktochart.com/output/2297869-learning-intelligenceFor much more on LQ visit http://www.4c3d.wordpress.com where you will find 35+ articles covering every aspect of LQ with some written from the teacher and learner perspective as well as the parent."

We are certainly planning great unit, but we are not always making sure there is a point at which the unit become the students’ unit."
