Do youÂ encourage creativity, imagination and initiative?Or is it more important that students learn to playÂ to the game of school? Are you constantly seeking ways to pique learnersâ€™ curiosity and provoke thinking ?Or are you usuallyÂ covering content and ensuring they learn what they need to know? My curious grandson Shai is a fearless explorer and learner at the age of two, and I often wonder what effect school will have on him.  Hereâ€™s what four year olds said about imaginationâ€¦ What is your imagination? Do adults have an imagination? And then hereâ€™s what Grade 2s said about storiesâ€¦ (They had just been exposed to a range of lovely stories told in different ways!) What do you know about stories? Why do we tell stories? Hmmâ€¦ Is that the â€˜school effectâ€™?"

We should learn from children more.I also attended an English class recently for university students. The teacher had us sit for 45 mins. I learned so much just sitting thereâ€¦.never to leave students sitting and listening for 45 minsâ€¦.it is boring."
