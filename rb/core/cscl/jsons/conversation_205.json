I was a little taken aback to hear that you did this by checking online for the schools’ Naplan scores. What matters to you? An environment where… Naplan scores won’t reveal any of these. Edna PS. Try visiting the school, talking to students, teachers and parents and asking questions about the things you really care about…"

In some schools, the environment you refer to has difficulty surviving.I also worry that young teachers are learning to “teach to the test” because of the pressures they are feeling to improve Naplan results, no matter how good the results are.I hope many parents take note of your sage advice."

They want to try to force them into a mold when they are all unique individuals with unique and individual abilities and talents. why not allow them to express them and let them grow in their abilities? I really appreciate this post as a future teacher and (in the far future) parent. Thank you for posting!"

        "text": "I wish there were a ratings system for the environment you described. Ultimately, a child’s success in life does not correlate to how well s/he scored on a standardized exam. For too many years, I have felt the pressure to “teach to the test”. This ideology sucks all the joy out of teaching — and learning, too. Until parents feel empowered to ask the important questions you’ve outlined, the system won’t change. Parents should also know that more often than not, an A rated/graded school is NOT what one might imagine it to be. The data and numbers and standards are routinely manipulated to achieve an illusion of greatness.So, yes, talk to teachers and other students and parents and try to visit classrooms midyear when student work is displayed. Get multiple opinions. Most importantly, nurture your child’s curiosity and personal passions outside the classroom."
