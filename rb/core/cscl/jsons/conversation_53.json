        "text": " Whether your students are completing assignments, inquiring into areas of their interest, covering curriculum or exploring their passions, to what extent does it feel (to you, as much as to them) as if they are simply complying and ‘doing school’? How can we extend learning ‘beyond the project’ and ensure it’s a powerful learning experience, rather than a task for school? (Hint: the answer does not lie in assessment criteria, rubrics or grades.) 1. Do you LISTEN more than you talk? 2. Are the learners really inquiring, in the broadest sense of the word? Look at the description of inquiry from Making the PYP Happen. Are they doing most of these things? Or just researching? 3. Will this inquiry be worthwhile? Will the learners experience challenges and figure out how to overcome them?  Support them in feeling comfortable in the ‘learning pit’?  4. Is the inquiry concept driven? Are the learners doing more than just finding facts and information? 5.  Do the learners have ownership? Will this inquiry help them grow, not just in knowledge of content, but as learners? Some questions to support their ongoing reflection:  6. Are the learners thinking critically and creatively about the content they explore? A variety of less common thinking routines that can extend their thinking: Think Puzzle ExploreCircle of viewpointsGenerate Sort Connect ElaborateTug for TruthParts Purposes and ComplexitiesPeople Parts InteractionsThink Feel CareImagine if… 7. Are the learners able to think about how their inquiries impact on other people? Will they be motivated to take action?  8. Will they explore ways of extending the learning beyond the classroom? 9. Will there be opportunities to identify problems and issues and develop solutions?  For some learners, the design thinking process might be useful:  10. Will learners have opportunities to express their  learning meaningfully and creatively? How will learners present, represent and/or share their learning? Will they choose to express their learning through a creative medium such as art or film? Will they paint or sculpt? Will they write poetry? Set it to music? Do an expressive dance? Create a stop motion animation? Build a model? Develop an app? Design a website? Write a book? Organise a debate? Start a blog? Make a speech? Create a campaign? Lead a workshop?  Will they do, say, think, feel, want… or be something different as a result of this learning? "
