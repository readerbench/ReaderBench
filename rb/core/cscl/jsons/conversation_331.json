He once wrote a post entitled Missing: My PLN and we have been friends ever since. He’s one of the organisers of RSCON3. The world is full of generous educators, willing to share with anyone who is open to learning. You don’t even need to leave home to find them. Anyone can participate in the online 3-day Reform Symposium Conference from 29th July to 1st Aug (depending on where in the world you are!) Here’s why… (How did we get to 20?! My posts always have 10!) Teaching is changing.  Ways of learning are changing. The possibilities are endless… Join us. What’s the worst that can happen?  "
