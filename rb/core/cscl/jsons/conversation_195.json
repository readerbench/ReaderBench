        "text": " Billed as the biggest educational technology conference in Australia, I note with interest as I sum up the big ideas from EduTECH, that they are not about the technology. These were some of the messages from the likes of Dan Pink, Stephen Heppell, Ewan McIntosh, Alan November, Stephen Harris , Andrew Churches and Sir Ken Robinson. I‘ll keep it brief, with links to other posts that elaborate. You can apply the big ideas to all kinds of learners, teachers and students alike.. 1. OwnershipEnable choice. Foster independence. Encourage responsibility. 2. CollaborationLearn together. Grow ideas. Build community. 3. CreativityExperiment. Play. Make something. 4. Problem solving/findingThink differently. Find solutions. Seek new problems. 5. CuriosityAsk questions. Notice. Wonder. 6. DiversityOne size does not fit all. Differentiate. Personalize learning. 7. FlexibilityRethink school. Create new spaces. Unlearn. 8. Relevance Make it real. Solve real life problems. Create for an authentic audience. 9. ConnectionBuild a PLN. Flatten classroom walls. Participate. 10. ChangeDo one new thing. Influence someone else. Shift the sand, one ‘teaspoon’ at a time…"

In the light of all the top down heavy handed push towards high stakes testing in the States (and in Oz as I understand it) what gets lost is the craftsmanship of the artesian teacher that provides the richness and depth of the learning experience for all.  I would love to continue the conversation please feel free to email me at penningm52@gmail.com.Thanks for your continued work for your students and your time spent with us in your blog."

        "text": "Good summary, the big ideas had nothing to do with technology. Perhaps we have really crossed the threshold where technology is like it was when I was a kid – the phone – you lifted the receiver, dialled, waited for an answer, spoke and hung up; No worrying about applets, java, OS, compatibility and in general how it worked, you just got on with the important stuff. We can now get on with learning!"
