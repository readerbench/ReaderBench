        "text": " The power of filming and then watching yourself teach has become evident during our coaching and growth review processes. What did you notice? What are the patterns?  What do they make you think? What surprised you? Does what you see yourself doing match what you think you do? On a larger scale, having educators from other schools visit us in the past few weeks has provided a similar opportunity. Viewing ourselves through the eyes of others and becoming aware of different perspectives has been both validating and enlightening. In the process of planning for and evaluating the visits and observing our school’s practice through a different lens, we have asked ourselves the same sorts of questions. Does our practice align with our beliefs about learning? Some years ago we spent time collaboratively developing a set of learning principles that encapsulate our beliefs about how learning best takes place. Since then we have worked at deepening understanding of these principles and ensuring that they underpin every decision we make in regard to learning within our school.  Our learning principles: Developing learning principles is the easy part.  How do you ensure that practice aligns with beliefs? Initially this reflection led me to thinking about the barriers; factors that are often out of my/ our/ sometimes-even-the-school’s control, but I’ve started building a list of things that are working well so we can consider how to amplify those. (This is the influence that exploring coaching has had on my thinking. I can even coach myself now!) As educators we live the learning principles ourselves through… How does your school ensure that your practice aligns with your beliefs?"

Teachers were filmed teaching a lesson in the classroom then sat with a mentor to watch and reflect on their teaching. It inspired me to film myself in my classroom. It was so hard to watch myself. However it was a very eye opening experience and one I should consider doing again, if I dare! Thanks for the link love."
