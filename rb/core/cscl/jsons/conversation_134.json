        "text": " There are hoops on the floor and cards with each staff member’s name on them. The task is to silently place the cards into the hoops indicating existing teams in the school. In the first round we are not permitted to move cards placed by others. It’s an interesting, yet frustrating process! How can I place some of the cards assigned to me if others have already created teams with which I don’t agree? Once everyone has had a turn to explain their placements, we move on to the second round, silently again, now with the freedom to move and replace names in different configurations. By the third round, there are overlapping hoops, string has been added to demonstrate connections across hoops and some names have been written on more than one card…  The process reveals that: The process is part of a discussion by our leadership team and the next steps will include all teachers examining the existing teams, defining their purpose, identifying the teams they belong to and would like to join… Are all our teams effective? and another question… Reflections:"

I got intrigued and curious about your hoops and the process of this learning engagement. Could you give me more details? Did you use a special protocol for the sharing of the groups? Did you do a post activity after this? Such a nice and enlightening idea! Warm wishes, Vanessa."
