Do you come out of every meeting with a plan for action or a sense of where to go next? To be honest, we often used to go round in circles in our meetings, talk at the same time, interrupt each other… We are a passionate bunch, and it was never through disrespect, rather a result of caring a great deal, having lots of ideas, wanting our opinions heard.. Since introducing Meeting Wise agendas, our meetings have become much more focused. The Meeting Wise authors highlight four aspects for careful consideration when planning successful meetings: Today in our meetings:  I took most of these statements from the plus /delta we do at the end of meetings, in which participants share what went well and what could be improved. This is usually addressed at the start of the next meeting of the particular group. Learning Team Leaders have received a copy of Meeting Wise and all teams are gradually improving their meetings by implementing the suggested procedures and protocols and adapting them to our needs. Highly recommended! (See my earlier post in which I applied the Meeting Wise questions to classroom learning.)"

Too often they do not give enough information about the topics to be discussed to allow preparation and the result is gossip and opinion. Two years ago my frustrations got the better of me and I wrote to the God of “Managed Meetings”!Here is what I said. http://wp.me/p2LphS-10"
