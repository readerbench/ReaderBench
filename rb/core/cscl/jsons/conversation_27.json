        "text": " It’s exciting to see teachers adopting the idea of thoughtfully considered reflective questions for themselves, as well as for the learners, in continued pursuit of the goal of developing the whole child – and the whole teacher! – rather than simply focusing on curriculum content. If I want the children in my class to be creative, how might I encourage creative experimentation? How will I foster creative thinking and problem solving? If I want to develop writers who consider audience and purpose in their writing, how will I help them find opportunities to write for an authentic audience? If I think feedback is an important part of learning, how will I promote the giving and receiving of effective peer feedback? If I want learners to be empathetic and understand different perspectives, how will I ensure that all points of view are considered to help them develop empathy? If I want the next generation to make sustainable choices, how will I help them to understand the impact of their choices and to become thoughtful, principled global citizens? If I want them to care about their environment, how will I foster a genuine sense of shared responsibility? If I don’t want them to see mistakes as failure, how might I help learners use their struggles to develop resilience? If I want my students to be positive, active digital citizens, how can I provide authentic contexts to practise digital citizenship? And how will I help them understand that positive active citizenship applies online or off? In a recent collaborative planning session, while developing the notion of iTime (or Genius Hour) into an opportunity for self reflection and personal growth, the Year 6 team took this type of reflective questioning to another level! What do I notice about myself as a teacher? What skills and dispositions do I need to develop as a teacher…?   "

One thing that I would add is: if we teach our students the secrets passion of learning through inquiry, why not share our own inquiries with them?Why not share the process that took us to learn something that wasn’t initially there? Why not tell them “this is not what I teach, this is what I do”?"
