        "text": " How can we provide better opportunities for learning to be expressed creatively?¬†¬†Do students have choice or does everyone have to do the same thing in the same way?¬†What possibilities are there for students to explore different media for creative expression?¬†How is creativity encouraged and developed? During our Year 6 PYP exhibition unit next term, students will explore how¬†‚ÄòSocial inequities create a need for action in the world‚Äô.¬†¬†Within this broad conceptual understanding, students will follow their areas of interest and decide on their own individual and small group inquiries. They will research and investigate their chosen areas independently, with support from teachers and mentors as required. Instead of their usual weekly art and music classes, this year for the first time, students will further explore the central idea through a choice of art, drama, music, film, poetry or technology. While some of these will already naturally be incorporated into the students‚Äô presentation of their learning, there will be a two hour block each week, devoted to a deeper exploration of their elected medium. I was really excited by the possibilities of this when the idea was first conceived in collaboration with Elena and Dani, our art and music teachers. They were keen to work with kids exploring their preferred medium, rather than all 95 Year 6 ¬†students. ¬†The idea was further developed in a chat with Jeremy McDonald on the other side of the world, who asked provocative questions to help me clarify both the rationale and the details. There was enthusiastic support from the Year 6 teachers and I‚Äôm well on the way to finding volunteers keen to facilitate each of the groups. Yesterday I shared this idea ¬†with a couple of young educators I know. ¬†One suggested a range of creative ideas to deepen the students‚Äô understanding of social inequity through creative exploration. I think if she was in Year 6 herself, she might struggle to choose which of the groups to participate in. The other provoked me to think about kids who might not be interested in any of the options. ¬†Will they choose film or technology simply because they are less interested in the arts, rather than because they find those options exciting? Will there be students who don‚Äôt like any of the options? Should we be offering something additional? I know this plan is an improvement on the way things used to be, because"

This will spike the students creativity and hopefully help them find something that they are interested in. I remember when I was in elementary school I loved having art class once a week, but when we had music class I never liked it. Mainly because I don‚Äôt know how to read music, I just liked to listen to it. So, for the students to be able to choose their own class, this will definitely create more excitement and interest while the students are in school! Great idea! I wish I had this growing up!-Emily"

As we discussed, I think the art, drama, music, film, poetry or technology were more of ways to share their learning during/at the end of the process. Are their specific tools they will use to gather the information; to organize the information; to make sense of the information; to synthesize the information? Perhaps some other tools can be modeled to help them DURING the process‚Ä¶things like Evernote, Diigo, Webspiration (or Inspiration), Google Docs, etc. Those are ones that come to me now, but I‚Äôm sure there are dozens more. Additionally, are they collaborating with other students and experts? Voicethread is a nice way to put a question out their and get feedback; so is a blog. Just some more ideas. I‚Äôm excited to see the process and see how the students engage in all of this."

It also might be worth exploring the different ways art has been used to respond to social issues, such as to disrupt dominant social orders, as a form of protest, to express emotions, and to further social or political agendas. Once students know where they are situated in terms of the history of art(s) as social action and they have been given time, space, and guidance to determine where they will go, I think this will be really powerful. Keep us updated!"
