        "text": "  I just returned from the IBAP conference in Singapore. ¬†The theme was ‚ÄòUnlocking the Treasure Within, focusing on the challenges and successes of educators around the world, who strive to promote broader knowledge, deeper understanding and meaningful action.‚Äô There was a great deal about the conference that was interesting and thought provoking. Amongst the keynote speakers, stand-outs were Wade Davis, explorer-in-residence at the National Geographic with his stunning photographs of different cultures and Professor James Tooley, who talked about his research into low cost private schooling in developing countries. There were some breakout sessions that got me thinking, such as James McDonald on the challenges of educational change and Seetha Murty who described the transition from a conventional to an IB school in India, against the flow of the prevailing educational system and beliefs. I was exposed to new ideas and I made connections. ¬†But I have to wonder about the fact that in 2010 you can attend a conference with 800 educators and every single session involved sitting in lines facing a lecturer. ¬†The only form of engagement with the subject matter was Q & A at the end of sessions. ¬†There wasn‚Äôt even free wireless internet. ¬†I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder‚Ä¶ ¬†if this is how educators themselves present new learning, how will education ever change?

So true.I think conferences still have a place in helping us learn ‚Ä¶ but usually in the informal sessions (in the bar?) afterwards when we chew over with friends and colleagues what we heard the speakers say. Perhaps the backchannel allows us (and those not present) to do that ‚Äòlive.‚ÄôThe question is then, how do we allow our students to do the same? Give them the chance to deconstruct and reassemble what they‚Äôve experienced that is, not meet up in the bar of course! üòâ"

Wade Davis really made me think about how I see the world and how limited my view is.Would you believe it today in the Age newspaper, (read over my morning coffee as it is holidays)  there is a whole article on indigenous wisdom.Yes ‚Ä¶ to bring indigenous knowledge to our teaching  so the children see multiple ways of relating to their world.I know how limited I am at the moment but my journey has just begun.Science through stories and dance‚Ä¶ in other cultures‚Ä¶ history through living people.. medicine through ancient healing . I am so looking forward to my new learning‚Ä¶  and know how much I have to let go old mindsets,  to view the world through different lenses."

There have been times when I know for sure presenters haven‚Äôt taken any notice of Maslow‚Äôs Heirarchy of Needs, when participants have been too uncomfortable for learning to take place. Effective communicators are also better at transmitting messages than ineffective ones. As an adult learner, I was recently reminded of this fact yet again."
