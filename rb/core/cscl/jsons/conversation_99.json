        "text": " I love chatting with my colleague about approaches to pedagogy and how to encourage teachers to reflect and grow. This week’s conversation gets us thinking about a shift in focus required for (some) beginning teachers… and some who’re not beginning. We attempt to define it. Is it a shift in focus from: How often do you say these sorts of things in your classroom? Are you depriving your students of opportunities to make decisions and reflect on them, learn from mistakes, become independent learners, think for themselves and… really LEARN? What are the effects when teachers say things like this? (Observed in class visits this week) Consider your practice…. Are you providing opportunities for meaningful learning?  Or are you and your students ‘doing school’?"

Sharing one’s learning is great learning too, so sometimes its just creating the oppurtunities for parents to come in to a student showcase and see what their children have been up to."

        "text": "Thank you for sharing. I give my students choice on so many different levels. And they don’t like it. Students are conditioned to play school. Many times my “A” students have the hardest time. They will ask me to tell them what to do so that they can get it done.  One of my favorite lines is, “I don’t know. What do you think?” But it is a challenge, it is messy, and it takes more time to allow students to learn. Thank you, again for sharing."

        "text": "Hi Ed:  STILL FOLLOWING! I enjoy reading your post.This post seems to be advocating MORE student-centered learning in classrooms and in Pre-service conferences.  I might caution that it appropriate to do so (i.e. to encourage independent thinking and student-centered learning.  However, teacher-centered instructional paradigms are also extremely important.  In my book the Dichotomy of Instructional Design, I advocate for both approaches to teaching AND learning.  Student-centered when the curriculum is of a non-technical nature AND Teacher-centered when technical knowledge and skills are to be mastered (i.e. Competency-based vs. Outcome-based) curriculum.
