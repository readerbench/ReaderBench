        "text": " Back at school for the start of the new school year. Â Students start on Monday. Â So much to doâ€¦ I think Iâ€™ll procrastinate and write a blog post instead ðŸ™‚ What kind of students will I be teaching? Â Iâ€™ve had a â€˜handoverâ€™ from last yearâ€™s teachers, but I generally prefer to give every child the opportunity for a fresh start, and not form any opinions till I get to know them. Â There is (of course) a direct correlation between the teacherâ€™s perception of a child and the way the child learns, acts and achieves. Â If she knows the teacher believes in her, she will usually live up to expectations.Â This seems like a great video for the start of the new school year here in Australiaâ€¦  The clip reminds me of the beautiful Hindi film Taare Zameen Par, (called Every Child is Special in English), which I recently watched. Â It was a gift from a friend who appreciates the uniqueness of every child and places a high value on teachers, teaching and learning. Â The movie is about a dyslexic boy and the teacher who believed in him, Â but also about perceptions, issues in education, competitivesness, teacher/student relationships and parental expectations. Â Every teacher should see it! "
