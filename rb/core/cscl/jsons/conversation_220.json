        "text": " We met this week for collaborative planning of a new unit of inquiry for the start of the new school year… Times have changed. We have changed.Planning is not coming up with a range of activities or developing a series of lesson plans. It’s a time to consider the rationale behind the unit and discuss conceptual ideas. A time to create a range of possible provocations which engage learners in the big ideas. A time to plan opportunities in which authentic student-directed learning can occur. Pre thinking includes… Our process… Brainstorm the big ideas – respect, diversity, belonging, co-existence, contribution, community, relationships, interactions, culture, rights, citizenship, values, cooperation. Decide collaboratively on the desired conceptual understandings – Come up with one conceptual word that defines the essence of the unit – Community Write the central idea – This needs to be a broad conceptual understanding, globally significant, relevant and engaging, which invites inquiry. We take some quiet time to write it individually, then discuss, adjust and adapt until we have consensus. Central idea – Communities are enriched by the contributions of individuals and groups. Is it perfect? We’re not sure. Nor are we sure of the paths the learning might take, what the learners might discover and uncover along the way, where exactly the inquiry might lead for different individuals and classes… We are sure that… In a way, our collaborative planning session has been an embodiment of our central idea: The Year 3 teachers, teaching and learning facilitators, teacher librarian and the ICT facilitator have spent several hours working and thinking together. The music and PE teachers have dropped in for a while too to share their ideas. We have built a sense of community within the group and been enriched by the contributions of every member…"

We used to worry that we were not getting the work done . Now we know that when we debate the issues that the unit uncovers it will be a great inquiry. I really look forward to our planning as its a time to think together ."

        "text": "Thanks for describing your process Edna. I have referred back to several of your posts on the Inquiry process whilst in the middle of my own class inquiries – kind of like a health checkup for my inquiry!I like the stage where individuals write their own take on the central idea, then discuss it together before reaching consensus. It seems an essential ingredient: to listen to others’ perspectives, points of view and understandings before creating a common statement.The Learner Profile: I believe that I can’t lose sight of this at any stage of planning an Inquiry. What do you think?cheersBrette"

Write their take on what the CI might be at various points along the way? Do you belong to PYPthreads Ning? There’s a great thread about it there.Yes, the learner profile is the overarching goal. It seems to be becoming more implicit than in used to be for us. Take the unit above for instance…Edna"
