        "text": " I discovered by accident that people enjoy lists. Readers appreciate easily accessible information. If  ideas are packaged in point form, everyone wants to read and pass them on. Perhaps this is a sign of our times. People are busy. We like things that are quick and easy to digest. We’re used to flicking from one tab to the next in the browser, skimming for items that catch our attention. 10 ways to attract readers to your blog… 1.  Start a ’10 ways…’ series. 2.  Write a post on 10 ways to get students to own their learning 3. Write a post on 10  ways to foster a love of learning  4. Write a post on 10 ways to create a culture of thinking 5. Write a post on 10 ways to grow as an educator 6. Write a post on 10 ways my thinking has changed 7. Write a post on 10 ways to think about your learning space 8. Write a post on 10 ways to help students develop a PLN 9. Keep the posts short and to the point. 10. Number the ideas.  But, now that I have your attention, let me be honest. I find it disappointing that these are the posts that attract the most readers. Sometimes I write posts that I think are really important about things that I want to share and discuss. And sometimes those posts are read and passed on far less enthusiastically than the ’10 ways…’ posts. Sometimes hardly anyone comments on the very posts that I hope will be read, considered, debated, shared and responded to. Do I need to assemble my ideas into lists of 10 points each? My intention was never to write to attract readers though.  I write my blog as much for myself as for anyone out there who wants to read it. My blog is a place to reflect. It’s a place to clarify my thinking and synthesize the parts of my learning. It’s a place to share examples of great learning at my school. It’s a way to think through ideas and grow as a learner myself. If you want to join me, please do… even though my ideas might not always be presented  in a convenient ’10 ways’ package!"

We are all busy and if all I am faced with is a large body of text with no headings and little spacing I am less inclined to read. The format is harder to cope with and I am unclear just by glancing at the post what it is all about."

Funny thing is, I probably wouldn’t have read this post, except that the tweet that brought me here was sarcastic enough to let me know what you really thought about Top 10 lists. hahaWhile I appreciate a short read, I tend to get too verbose on my own blog and end up with “novels” instead of blog posts. 😉 But then, as you say, sometimes we write more for ourselves than for our readers. Nice post. 🙂"

I have just started a blog and my main priority with it is to get myself to write… so that I can reflect, think, synthesize all the things that I read and think about and converse about–in my coursework and through my PLN, practice my writing since some day soon I will be a teacher of writing, and most of all, to just learn.  Of course, it would be great to have readers and comments every now and then, but I know that as long as I am blogging, I am pushing myself to really learn and make the most of the opportunities I have to grow as a person and as a preservice–and eventually full-time–teacher.Thanks for writing insightful posts.  I read your posts regularly, regardless of whether they are 10-point lists or more lengthy prose.  I learn from you either way."

If you write for yourself, you’ll reach all the people you want to write for.” -in W. Zinsser’s ‘On Writing Well,’ 5th ed….yeah, but heck, those “10 ways…” lists don’t hurt do they?

I think there are lots of times the students don’t think they have anything to say but in this format they can have success and then you can use the list to delve into deeper writing.  Thanks for sharing.As for me, I am new to Blogs and Twitter but I have to say the ‘Top 10″ lists are too quick for my taste I prefer to have the debate that read about others opinions.  When I pull up a short Blog I think “That’s it?”"
