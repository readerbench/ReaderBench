        "text": " I’ve just had my first experience of a #Learning2 conference and loved the opportunities to… The ‘Disrupt Strand’ was a different kind of experience, not least for the opportunity to work with facilitators Sam Sherratt and Rebekah Madrid and other educators who care deeply about learning and the state of education. Other people who, as the descriptor on the website states: It was a personalised learning experience, in which the participants had the opportunity to work in teams to develop something we would like to implement over the next school year. My team (which had representation from Australia, Singapore and China… as well as South Africa, India and New Zealand, if you count where people are from, not just where they work!) grappled with ideas for shifting from ‘doing school’ to the way we think learning should look today. We refined our ideas after chatting with a couple of grade 5 students from ISM, who shared their perceptions of school, what’s important to them and how it could be better.  The problem: How can we break the restrictive moulds which limit the learning in our schools? (Single subject silos, rigid timetables, confined classrooms, grouping by age) and work towards a more flexible model that allows for more personalisation, choice and ownership?  Our pitch: What if school was like #Learning2? Can we (that includes you) introduce one LEARNING2 day at a time, until eventually it becomes LEARNING TODAY?  Watch this space if you want to join us!"
