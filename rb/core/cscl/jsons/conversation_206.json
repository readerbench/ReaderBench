        "text": " â€˜There is never enough timeâ€˜ is a frequent cry by teachers around the world. It was one of the reasons for handing over ownership of our PD day last week to the teachers. After an initial survey on effective professional learning , it was clear that teachers would value an entire day to pursue their own learning. The teachersâ€™ reflections are a clear indication of the dayâ€™s success. Thanks to Kath Murdoch for suggesting that we ask what they noticed about themselves as learnersâ€¦ There is much for teachers to take away, not just from what they worked on, but from their process, their challenges and from what they noticed about themselves as learners. They can apply what they learned from all of those in their classrooms. Messages to take back to the classroom: Learning is enhanced whenâ€¦ â€¦which takes us back to where we started: â€˜There isnâ€™t enough timeâ€™.  And there will never be enough time, for as long asâ€¦"

Thanks for being a voice for all teachers."

        "text": "We have block scheduling at our school, which helps alleviate the problem of time. My issue is usually one of having too many diverse minds/learning styles in the room, and too many personalities and interests to manage. Also, like many teachers, my time management concerns deal largely with scoring state mandated essays x 125 students x 6-8 times per year, attending weekly meetings during my planning time, and the ever-increasing administrative paperwork load. My personal â€˜favoriteâ€™, however, is sitting through PDDs that teach the same theory/techniques over and over again. Every year or so, facilitators recycle and update an old idea with a new name and graphic organizers. Without fail, I feel as if my time would be better spent planning in my classroom."
