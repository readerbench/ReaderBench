You can read them here, but among other things, I talked about the fact that when I started, I had one reader and never imagined that I would ever have many more ðŸ™‚ Now, 4 months later, I am addicted to blogging. Â Itâ€™s an opportunity to express ideas and to experiment. Â Itâ€™s a place to share new discoveries. Â It helps me to clarify my thoughts.Â Â It allows me to communicate great learning that happens at our school. Â Itâ€™s a way to connect with other educators world-wideâ€¦ I have moved from thisâ€¦  to thisâ€¦  Why do YOU blog? â€¦ "

I think part of the reason that I keep doing is that I find so many ideas and things that I want to keep track of. The blogging alliance has helped me to realize that the things I want to remember are good for other people too.  I love the cartoon pictures above and can so relate to them. ðŸ™‚"

I started blogging in November because I had just finished uni and was beginning my journey as a new teacher. I wanted a place to reflect on my experiences teaching. I was also inspired by my PLN on Twitter. So many of the educators that I follow have fabulous blogs and I learn so much from them. I havenâ€™t had much experience teaching, so I feel a little intimidated when I do get around to publishing a post. I think to myselfâ€¦.who would be interested in what I have to say??Love your blog and Iâ€™m looking forward to reading more.Louise"
