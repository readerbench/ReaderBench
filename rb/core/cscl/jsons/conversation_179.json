If you read A Global Community, my chapter in the IB book Journeys in Communities of Practice, youâ€™ll see it there too. And if you participate in â€˜Direct Your Own Learningâ€˜, my session at theÂ Reform Symposium ConferenceÂ next weekend (time conversion here), youâ€™ll probably see it again. After the first day of the Melbourne GAFE summit, (Google for Education), I wondered if the conference was more about tools than learning. Â After the second day, with my thinking provoked by @mistersill and @betchaboyâ€˜s keynotes, some new ideas inspired by sessions learning (well, yes) tools, and some good conversation with other educators, Iâ€™m re-evaluatingâ€¦ It turns out the â€˜big pictureâ€™ looks like the one above!"

        "text": "After yesterdayâ€™s post, Edna, I was very keen to see what todayâ€™s would bring.  Iâ€™ve attended a number of Teach Meets now as well as the more extended â€˜Summitsâ€™ and even â€˜Academiesâ€™ and my frustration has been that they spend an awful lot of time on the â€˜whatâ€™ and the â€˜howâ€™ without getting to the â€˜whyâ€™.  Or rather a lot on the â€˜techâ€™ and the â€˜toolsâ€™ without getting to the â€˜teachâ€™ or the â€˜teamâ€™.  That part of it seems to happen by accident when the people at the even start to talk to each other.  To my mind, this is often a relic of the educational system the presenters have grown up with.  Sometimes, the â€˜howâ€™ can be really instructive: â€˜how to flip an elementary classroomâ€™ or â€˜how to use video to foster enquiryâ€™, but often itâ€™s still stuck in that older model where the speaker gives the audience some magic tricks to take back and sprinkle on their practice.  Iâ€™m glad you singled out Jim Sill (you got his Twitter handle slightly wrong in your post, by the way) and Chris Betcher because I know they â€˜get itâ€™.  Itâ€™s not about the tech: itâ€™s all about the learning, and thatâ€™s as true whether youâ€™re in a class of over-excited adults or a class of kids!"

        "text": "Thanks for the comment, Mark, and I think youâ€™re right. At a summit for google apps, which are â€˜toolsâ€™ after all, the sessions naturally have an emphasis on the â€˜whatâ€™ and the â€˜howâ€™, rather than the â€˜whyâ€™. I knew what I signed up for. But when I stepped away and looked at the big picture, I saw lots of passionate educators taking control of their own professional learning, actively participating and collaborating, sharing their practice, giving generously, learning appreciatively, demonstrating commitment and motivationâ€¦ in their school holidays! Not too bad ðŸ™‚Thanks for pointing out the typo -fixed."

That said, there are times when people â€˜just want to know how to do stuffâ€™ and this is presumably driven by some sort of purposeâ€¦ Itâ€™s when someone else ass[out of]u&mes we have the same purpose that the waters get clouded.Rob ðŸ˜‰"
