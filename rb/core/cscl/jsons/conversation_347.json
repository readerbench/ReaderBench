        "text": " We have a beautiful open space in our new Year 6 area, which could be a place for kids to learn together, work collaboratively in groups, share their learning with students from other classes. I wonder why it‚Äôs mostly empty‚Ä¶ I know‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs more convenient and more manageable to teach your own class. Every teacher prefers their own way of doing things.¬†Having kids spill out into the open area and work with kids from other classes would be noisy. It might be more difficult to monitor what everyone‚Äôs doing and whether they are on task. It would be difficult to keep control.¬† I think about my own learning in the past year. I work with someone who thinks differently than I do and we constantly learn from engaging in conversation and debate. I have a supportive in-school PLN with whom I think things through and find solutions. Working with a variety of teachers across campus means I have opportunities to engage in a ¬†variety of learning experiences. My learning is further enhanced by attending workshops and conferences in person and virtually. More than anything, I benefit from engaging with other educators around the world via Twitter and blogs.  I wouldn‚Äôt like to be stuck in the same room learning with the same group of people for a whole year. Learning can be messy and noisy. Putting a fence around it to keep it in limits the kind of learning that can take place. Let‚Äôs give our students opportunities to learn and create collaboratively, not just with the same group of co-learners all year. Let‚Äôs help them develop their own personal learning networks. Let‚Äôs open the gate‚Ä¶ "

Admittedly we were all adults, but surely what‚Äôs good for the goose is good for the gander. Some of the sessions were held in a big room with small and large ottomans on wheels, as we formed different groups, we‚Äôd roll the furniture around to suit our needs. There was lots of sharing, lots of learning and LOTS of fun. That sense of being able to manipulate your environment to suit your learning needs appeals to me!"

The year 6‚Äôs have to get 20 hours and the year 7‚Äôs have to get 30 hours.  I‚Äôm in year 7.  Alot of the hours can be done during lunch times and recess at school but it is up to us to arrange for some other activities outside of school.  Rachael‚Äôs grandma lives close to the nursing home and I think her Grandma and mum helped organise it.  My mum also volunteers for Meals on Wheels and I helped her deliver all the food to the peoples homes.Thanks again,Millie üòÄ"

Our junior school is only weeks away from moving into a new school which is built around open learning spaces.  Each building is designed to house two communities of 100 students (each in their own open learning space).  Although we have been working on our curriculum and pedagogy for many years now, there is still many staff who are finding this move challenging with regards to many of the reasons you mentioned above.   I am excited about what is ahead, but I know it is going to take some time to break these walls done!"
