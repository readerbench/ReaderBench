        "text": " You canâ€™t be a teacher, if you are not a learner. Iâ€™ve written many times about teachers as learners, professional learning, reading groups and learning through collaborative planning. I once posted 10 ways to grow as an educator, based on my reflections on my own learning and growth at that point in time. Â This week, Iâ€™m fortunate to be at an IB workshop in Chiang Mai, Thailand, training to be an IB workshop leader. Reflecting at the end of the first day, I have some ideas to add my list of ways teachers can learnâ€¦ 1. Engage with teachers from different places and cultures. Twitter is a fine place to start, if you canâ€™t meet them in person. 2. Interact with teachers who teach other disciplines and different age groups. Talk about learning in your context. Really listen to them talk about learning in theirs. 3. Get out of school! Learn in a beautiful, natural setting. Be inspired by nature. 4. Visit another school. Preferably one thatâ€™s very different from yours. 5. Watch other teachers teach or present. Learn from what they doâ€¦ and from what they donâ€™t do. 6. Tweet from a conference. Sum up the key points 140 characters at a time. 7. Interact with other people who share your passion. If youâ€™re lucky, you can find them in your school. If not, connect online. 8. Reflect on your own learning. Stop and think about what you learned. Write it down. A blog is best, a scrap of paper will do. 9. Teach teachers. Share your knowledge, experience, expertise and ideas with people who know as much and more than you do. 10. Be open-minded. There is something worth learning from every person you meet and every situation you find yourself inâ€¦ IB WorkshopÂ LeaderÂ Training Day #1"

I work closely with someone who thinks in a very different way than I do and we are constantly debating, â€˜arguingâ€™, justifying, rethinkingâ€¦ But that was in my original â€™10 ways to grow as an educatorâ€™ post! The thoughts in this one are based on my current learning context."

In addition, I would say observe your students more, interact with them outside the class more, let them speak more etc. There are just so many things we can learn from them..Cheers!"
