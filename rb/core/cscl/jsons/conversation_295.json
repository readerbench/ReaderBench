        "text": " Cross-posted (almost) from Inquire Within, a blog about inquiry.  Weâ€™re laughingÂ as we shift the tables to include the screen in our circle. Someone has offered to give her chair to the expected guest, forgetting momentarily that he is actually in Tennessee, USA and will be joining us via Skype! This group loves to learn together and weâ€™re meeting for breakfast an hour before school again today toÂ continue our discussionÂ ofÂ Making Thinking VisibleÂ by Ritchhart, Morrison and Church. I highly recommendÂ the book,Â the websiteÂ and the principles of visible thinking for all inquiry teachers. Our virtual guestsÂ PhilipÂ andÂ BethÂ take some time to adjust their sound and then a bit longer to adjust to our accents, but are soon participating in the discussion. Philip is a 6th grade teacher who recently did a course atÂ Harvardâ€™s Project ZeroÂ andÂ blogs hereÂ about his further exploration intoÂ Visible Thinking.Â Beth is a 2nd Grade teacher who incorporatesthese beliefs and strategies in her class too. They saw our reading group mentionedÂ on my blogÂ and asked if they could join, undeterred by the fact that we are in Australia! We use theÂ 4 Câ€™sÂ thinking routineÂ as a guide for todayâ€™s discussion. Itâ€™s a great routine for synthesising and organising ideas. Concepts: What are the big ideas? Connections: How does it connect to what we already know? Challenges: What do we find challenging? Changes: How have our actions and attitudes changed as a result? Todayâ€™s chapter focuses not just on the power of good questioning, but on how to listen carefully to what students say (and donâ€™t say). Â You can read my response to the chapter in an earlier postÂ â€˜Great questions have legsâ€˜. Iâ€™ve heard Ritchhart tell the story in person of how he observed great teaching and learning in classrooms then wondered why, although he carefully asked precisely the same questions as they had, the lessons did not go as well and he wasnâ€™t able to create the same kind of thinking culture. It was only when he learned the value of attentive and responsive listening, that he was able to create that culture in his own classes.Â How many teachers have a desired answer in their heads and stop listening as soon as they hear it?Â  The chapter also stresses the importance of documenting thinking. Most of the group agrees that this part is the most challenging. People talk about using sticky notes, which are easy to display, and journals, which are easier to keep. We consider whether one of the most effective ways of documenting and recording student thinking might be via a class blog. The question is what do you do with that documentation? Weâ€™ve started spending time in groups analysing students questions, discussing both what they reveal about each student and how they shape the direction of future teaching and learning. (but thatâ€™s for another post!) The conversation, as always in this group, reflects passion for and commitment to learningâ€¦ our own and that of our students.Â We conclude by reflecting on how our thinking has changed over time since we first began exploring Visible Thinking and Inquiry Learning. For the â€˜exit cardâ€™ we use another thinking routine â€˜I used to thinkâ€¦ Now I thinkâ€™. Even Philip is ready with his sticky note! I used to think PD was something by experts that took place a few days a year. Now I think powerful professional learning comes from creating a community of learners and developing Â a culture of thinking within your own school. And inviting the world in."

Sometimes learning moments or conversations you might otherwise miss are captured and can be used later. A little voice saying â€˜is that snowâ€™ I totally missed in the excited din of students seeing unusual weather outside. Being able to capture that moment and use it later was priceless."

I find this very productive and enriching as an educator. Sometimes, they are better than workshops!  Any idea how you started with this Ed?"
