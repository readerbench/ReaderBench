Does every school have… teachers who understand learning, who love to learn themselves, who provoke student inquiry and aren’t afraid to try new things to move learning forward? and teachers who go through the motions, with their eyes on the clock and who think teaching is just a job? Does every school have… units that inspire teachers and learners, provide opportunities for creativity and collaboration, engage the learners and excite them to want to inquire, explore and learn? and units that fall off the rails because of poor planning or misunderstanding or shortage of time or lack of motivation? Does every school have… leaders (at all levels) who are passionate about learning, who motivate, empower and innovate, who instigate change and shape culture? and leaders who dictate and enforce, focus on what’s expedient instead of on the learning and possibly don’t even care? Does your school?  "
