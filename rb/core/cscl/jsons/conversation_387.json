        "text": " As an educator, what‚Äôs the most valuable kind of PD been for you? In what context has your most meaningful or most exciting learning taken place? Reflecting on my own professional learning in recent times and considering what was most effective for me, has made me think‚Ä¶ If it works for us, it should work for them. The most valuable learning for me has been through: 1. Blogging Writing a blog has been a tool for synthesising my thoughts, clarifying my ideas and reflecting on my practice. Commenting on other blogs and responding to comments on my own has allowed me to engage¬†in professional dialogue. 2. Following my passions I love technology and the possibilities it opens up for flattening classroom walls. ¬†I have spent the past year experimenting with ways to make it happen across the school and learned a huge amount in the process. 3. Collaboration  Collaborating with my online PLN in a variety of ways has supported my learning in so many ways. I have an in-school PLN too and we achieve our best thinking and learning when we work together. 4. Global connections The benefits of ¬†learning from and with interesting people around the globe are immeasurable. My learning is enriched by interactions, through Twitter, blogs and Skype, with people of other cultures, different backgrounds and varied interests. 5. Owning my learning My most valuable learning has been in areas I have chosen, not via any compulsory staff PD. We‚Äôre making sure all staff PD for next year is based on choice. 6. Knowing why Related to the one above, ¬†starting from the ‚Äòwhy, rather than ‚Äòwhat‚Äô or ‚Äòhow‚Äù makes all the difference to learning. Matching learning to goals and interests means getting much more out of it. 7. Meaningful feedback Sharing my learning with colleagues at school and a global audience on my blog has meant opportunities for specific feedback to push my thinking forward and help me decide where to take my¬†learning¬†next. 8. Not sticking to the job description (curriculum) I have learned a huge amount in the past few years by using my initiative to explore new possibilities and¬†create my own opportunities. If I had limited myself to what was expected, I wouldn‚Äôt have moved forward in the ways I have. 9. Being curious Asking questions. Experimenting with new ideas. Seeking information. Making new connections. Being open-minded. 10. Focusing on learning, not on teaching The more I have focused on learning, both my own and that of my students, the better my teaching has become. It‚Äôs that simple. If these are the factors that have enhanced my own learning, shouldn‚Äôt I be providing my students with exactly the same sorts of learning opportunities? Shouldn‚Äôt we all?"

For me the biggest difference came when I stopped worrying about what I didn‚Äôt know (and when you teach technology, there‚Äôs a lot!) and shared with the kids what I didn‚Äôt know- and then worked with them to find answers. They love being the ‚Äútechxpert‚Äù and I like watching them glow with pride."

While I initially started writing on my blog as a way to chronologically reflect on my practice, starting with my student teaching, it irritated me that no one was reading. I‚Äôve since realized that writing about my experiences and recording my thoughts has been a tremendous benefit for me both personally and professionally. It is so good for me to go back and re-read what I was thinking to see whether or not I have grown. Thanks for sharing your list! Good stuff!"

Our class has been almost completely online based through our class blogs. Not only are we learning from assignments but also from each other when we comment on blogs every week. Furthermore, our projects are pretty much open-ended to whatever we would like to do or work on. In just these few points, we are using our blog to follow our passion about what we want to learn through collaborative work and then giving meaningful feedback to each other. These are just a couple of ways that I see our class as a similar learning style to what you wrote about."
