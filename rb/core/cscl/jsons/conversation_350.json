        "text": " A friend and I were discussing the idea of student evaluation of  teachers in order to improve teaching and learning. At the particular institution where this friend works, the idea was not well received by teachers. It might have been the way it was presented, perhaps the teachers feel threatened or are afraid of what might be revealed… or it might be the different perspective of a country and culture in which students are expected to show respect for teachers irrespective. I was surprised that teachers might not want to know what their students think. Thinking about the learning process is just as important as thinking about what you learn. But, as Dylan William says in the video below, there are many teachers who ‘try to cause learning without the students’ help.’  I’ve posted before about how we articulated our learning beliefs and are constantly unpacking them to help teachers shift the focus in our school from teaching to learning. Principle #5: Learning includes meta-cognition and reflection, which support learners taking ownership of their learning. So… Previous posts illustrating the learning principles: Principle #1: We learn in different ways, depending on abilities, learning styles, preferences and interests. Principle #2: Learning is active and social and is enhanced by collaboration and interaction. Principle #3: Learning takes place through inquiry: questioning, exploring, experimenting and problem solving. Principle #4: Learning includes acquisition of skills and knowledge, constructing meaning and transfer to different contexts.  "

        "text": "Really nice post.  I think you have done a marvelous job of stating the obvious.  Teachers should care enough about their students to relish their feedback on the learning environment in which they participate.  Learning is a two-way street.  There is a teacher and there is a learner (obvious).  If the learner isn’t learning, it may be that the teacher is not effectively teaching.  As teachers, we should desire feedback that gives clarity and direction to our purpose.  Your five principles lay a nice roadmap for what we should be doing with students.Thanks for the good work!Bob"

        "text": "We have some students who are new to our school and I spent some time with them sharing what a PYP school is all about. I asked them if they noticed anything different about their new school. They were particulary struck by the fact that their  teacher  didnt know all  the answers and that they had to think. As we talked further and visited other classrooms to see how thinking ” looked” in our PYP school, I was struck by the obvious fact that these children were not used to ” pulling their thinking out of their heads” and making it visible. They listened politely,  but the outside thinking and active whirring of  their learning that we mostly see in our PYP students was clearly not happening.  I am excited to see if these children will become “outside thinkers” , activate their brains, process, dissect and then debate. I am excited to see if they will own their own learning and become partners in learning."

I too think that students should be heard as a help with their learning. I am an Elementary Major and when I become an educator I will make sure I hear my students out."
