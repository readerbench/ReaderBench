It made me realise how much has changed and what still needs to. The posts I have chosen are not necessarily my most popular posts, but I write as much for myself as for anyone else, so here are eleven of my favourite posts from 2011… 1.  10 things to do on the first day of school  (January) 2.  How do teachers learn? (February) 3.  Open the gate… (Things have changed!) (April) 4.  Does your school..? (June) 5.  A school in Pune  (July) 6. Embracing technology (August) 7.  Play House  (August) 8.  Ignite, Engage, Inspire  (September) 9. What do you mean? (October) 10. Thoughts from my own inquiry (October) 11. Where do great ideas come from? (December)"
