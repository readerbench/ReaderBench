Â Next they uploaded their photos to the shared-drive so that everyone could share. Â My intention was to create a voicethread using the photos, but there were technical issues on the day, so at the last minute, I simply asked them to use the photos in a power-point presentation and insert audio to record what they wanted to say in Hebrew. Â Lots of skills were evident: findingÂ appropriateÂ vocabulary, speaking and listening; many kids wrote what they wanted to say first, so reading and writing too; collaboration, creativity, thinking, communication, cooperation, not to mention various tech skills. Â It was very engaging and I could sit on the sidelines and let the learning happen. After combining them into one presentation, I had hoped to upload it into voicethread, to allow for comments, Â but then I discovered that the audio wasnâ€™t supported. Â  A quick search on the classroom 2.0 ning introduced me to Slide Boom, and here we are!! Vodpod videos no longer available. "

I am extra happy to see that my favorite tree in the whole school was used often, including the photo being taken under it. Clever use of added pictures, like the colourful leaves (explained in hebrew) and of course the falling appleâ€¦even the bin. The children obviously had fun. Please tell them I loved it.ðŸ™‚Dani"
