I collated their thoughts  and brought them back for their approval, before using them as a basis for the essential agreement.  We all sign this agreement and constantly refer back to it if we find ourselves going off track and hindering our own or others’ learning. I was struck, yet again, by how much students understand their own learning.  This is a summary of the things they are aware of : We should  get students to run professional development for us teachers, really we should…"

I think that as educators we forget to ask ourselves these questions and can forget to consider how are students would answer (or never ask them to know first hand).

When students are involved in defining and reflecting on what learning looks like to them, it is so much more meaningful!"

It’s amazing how they can articulate their thoughts and share some sophisticated thinking  – they just need us to give them the space to do it. We are in the process of organising our state ICT conference and some of the suggestions have been that we should have more students present to share their learning experiences."

At the beginning of the school year, we all signed our class essential agreement.About four weeks ago, three students raised concerns about the essential agreement and how they would like to revisit them. We have all changed and gotten to know each other and that is not reflected in our new agreement."
