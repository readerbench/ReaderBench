Sheâ€™ll be sharing her passion for baking with some of her peers on Tuesday at our Year 6 #PassionsMatter conference. Â An update says: â€˜My kitchen is a hive of activity in preparation for Tuesday. The girls have been shopping independently this morning with their shopping list and budget (prepared by themselves). They are now preparing and packing all that they need for their workshop. Totally self directed! THIS is learning!!!!!!!!!!!!!!â€™Â  L is excited too, as expressed in an email to her teacher, discussing the purchase of materials for her sewing workshop. Â A has prepared an inspirational talk about how books capture her imagination and transport her to other worlds. Â T is writing his own book and will tell his peers about that. Â Jâ€™s talk uses take off and flight as a metaphor for achieving goalsâ€¦ In the lead up to the conference, our learners have been involved in authentic opportunities to write, speak, research, think, calculate, make decisions, collaborateâ€¦ and learn. Students have written inquiry emails,Â made phone calls, worked out costs for catering, placed orders, designed the logo and certificates, written speeches, given constructive feedback, planned and re-planned workshops.  The program includes some external presenters , who are all passionate, young role models some of whom have mentored the children in planning their sessions. Their workshops will provide opportunities for students to explore areas of passion such as song writing, story telling and sport coaching, as well as to engage with the big ideas of finding your passion, self belief, learning from failure and overcoming obstacles.Â  On Tuesday atÂ Passions Matter 2016, students will be speakers, workshop presenters, photographers, caterers, tweeters, bloggers and reflection group leaders.Â  This is powerful learning.Â  Why only once a year?Â What if we had days like this once a month?Â Once a week? How can we make thisÂ kind of meaningful, purposeful learning part of regular, daily school life? Â  The back storyâ€¦ From doing school to Learning 2 day Unleashing Learning Learning Unleashed The Story Within And even further backâ€¦ Why isnâ€™t school like a conference? A conference for kids"

The conference will kick it up a notch as we head into the final phase towards exhibition. The CI is Exploration  of interests and passions lead to learning and action.So no, not replacing exhibition, just a step along the way. I think the mentors are crucial. Teachers have mentored too, but the young (up to 30s) add an element of inspiration."
