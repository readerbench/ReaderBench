I love this collaborative curriculum review and think it would be amazing to do with the PYP teachers I work with, but I have a question about timing. We have our PYP re-authorization scheduled for March 2017, so I am wondering if you would recommend waiting and doing this activity as part of our 12 month self-study leading up to our visit, or do you think it would be relevant (and not redundant) to do now before we start our self-study? Thanks for your advice!"

The more ways you find for the staff to think about learning and teaching practice between now and the evaluation visit (and always!) the better. This is what we did in the build up to ours: https://whatedsaid.wordpress.com/tag/ib-self-study/In the end, I didnâ€™t care much for the visit itself. Itâ€™s the collaborative process of exploration along the way that makes it worthwhile."
