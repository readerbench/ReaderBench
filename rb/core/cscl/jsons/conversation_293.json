I am in there every day, sometimes several times a day,  yet the first time I notice it is in the background of a photograph taken in the room! What else have I not noticed today, this week, all year? What have I missed? I’m challenging myself to notice and record things that I might have been missing. What have you finally noticed that’s been in front of your eyes all the time?"
