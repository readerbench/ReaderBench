        "text": " I‚Äôm lucky to work at a school where most (but not all) of the teachers love to learn and will voluntarily turn up for a bit of professional learning before school or during their lunchtime. Almost the whole staff at our small ¬†K-2 campus participate in today‚Äôs lunchtime session, bringing along sandwiches and bowls of soup. It‚Äôs a Year 2 room, so the teachers are sitting on small chairs around tables designed for little learners, but this is their learning environment and they are comfortable in it. We have 40 minutes to think about thinking, explore one of the Visible Thinking routines and consider how it might be applied in the classroom. It‚Äôs one in a series of such gatherings where we work collaboratively on creating a culture of thinking. They have yet to read the book Making Thinking Visible¬†and I hope to explore it with them in our coming sessions. We start by getting into groups and collaboratively generating ideas about thinking in the classroom. It‚Äôs easiest to do this on sticky notes, as they can be readily moved and sorted for the next part of the routine. It‚Äôs interesting that each group generates different ideas and sorts them in different ways. The ensuing conversation reveals not only how these teachers think about thinking, ¬†but how productive such an activity could be in getting students to justify and explain their thinking. Predictably, someone asks whether this routine is suitable for younger learners* and it‚Äôs time to watch part of this clip of Silvana and her little learners exploring ways to look after our planet, via the ‚ÄòGenerate, Sort, Connect, Elaborate‚Äô routine. (Don‚Äôt turn off before the little pouter at 5:44!) ¬† There follows a great conversation about the picture of practice we have just seen, how the teacher engages the children, how the children respond, the process of the routine,¬†the potential for application and some possible problems and solutions. In a flash, lunchtime is over and the teachers need to return to class, even though we haven‚Äôt actually completed the thinking routine ourselves. In fact, elaborating on and further developing the ideas generated about thinking today will be the goal of our future sessions. I have never taught K-2 classes and the teachers invite me to come and team teach with them to experience the reality of their learning context. I can‚Äôt wait!"

I have thought for years (well, decades actually, but man, that makes me seem old) that we could move overtly share the process of learning, even with younger students.  I tried some last year with your 4th graders, and yes, they ‚Äúgot it‚Äù just fine.  To some extent this is one of the core theses of my book, The Falconer; part of the book is a series of short stories that teach strategic thinking, even to youngsters.  2nd grade?  Not sure, but how knows.  The 4th graders got it.  You can download the book intro on my blog site at http://learningpond.wordpress.com if you like.Thanks for sharing!"

She will be thrilled to know other people are using her work to inspire teachers.for more info in  the work we are doing you can visit: http://www.educationfirsatinc.com I hope to keep sharing and growing collaboratively üôÇI loved your blog too! I will be sharing it too with our team üôÇ"
