        "text": " It’s great to work in a school where a bunch of dedicated teachers will come in voluntarily before school to share practice, discuss ideas and learn together. Our group is enhanced by the variety of age, experience and subect discipline of the teachers who come. Our head himself comes, which is both supportive and encouraging. The focus of this week’s session was stepping back and allowing students to be more responsible for their own learning. It’s a difficult one for most teachers. Veterans are used to having control and often find it hard to let go. Less experienced teachers are often struggling to gain control in the classroom. I think you need to have some control before you can let it go… We watched Sugata Mitra’s TED talk in our last session, so today we just had a quick look at a short clip of The Hole in the Wall. It was a good trigger to provoke thinking about just how capable kids are of learning independently. We used the thinking routine ‘Headlines’ to capture its essence. It’s one I use often in my class to help students capture the gist of things. We imagined what it would be like to have someone else set you tasks, give you instructions, check up on you, tell you when to do what all day long. We discussed ways to ‘let go‘, like talking less, testing less and focusing on learning rather than on work. We talked about the importance of classroom layout. We discussed the way kids tend to ‘talk through’ the teacher and how difficult it is to get them to look at each other in a whole class discussion. Rubi told us she sits outside the circle while her students talk. We talked about the challenge of personal goal setting and Hailey shared how her students sometimes set goals for a particular lesson, so that they can focus on them, rather than long term ones they tend to forget. We talked about the value of feedback, not just to the teacher but between members of a group. We wondered how habit can be overcome, when kids come to us already conditioned to see the teacher as ‘boss of learning’. I took the issue to my classroom after the session. I love to tell them that teachers are learners too and get their perspective on the things we have discussed. I gave them scraps of paper to jot their thoughts on and asked them to think about all the teachers they have known so far. Here are some of their responses… What are ways in which teachers tend to take control of learning? What helps you take more control of your own learning? Nothing to add…  "

Your postings inspire me to reflect on my daily interactions with the learners in my classroom. You demonstrate the power of the PYP and I wonder whether it is possible to have such a community without the PYP framework?Mitra’s TED talk demonstrated how some teachers can get in the way of learning and how letting go is powerful. CheersRobyn"

        "text": "Hi Edna,just stumbled on your blog. Sorry for being a wet blanket. While letting children decide what they want to learn is motivating, when do we let go? So a colleague of mine shared how some schools in Australia allow their children to learn arithmatic or language (or ….) even at a young age. Where do we draw the line between what is basic and what is optional and thus for the optional, go where your heart is?I am a teacher from Singapore, and I think our views of what is basic is much more than what others may think (maybe too much). I agree with the need for stduent interest driven education, but when?"

        "text": "I’m not suggesting letting go of all learning. There are certainly basic skills in many subject areas that need to be explicitly taught. Even within the teaching of ‘basics’, teachers don’t need to be in control of every aspect of learning though. Learners can be given opportunities to practice the skills in different ways and choices too. That doesn’t mean kids are sent off to learn what they like when they like. (although it might in some settings!)We strive to have inquiry as a stance at our school. It might look like some of these…-exploring, wondering and questioning-experimenting and playing with possibilities-making connections between previous learning and current learning-making predictions and acting purposefully to see what happens-collecting data and reporting findings-clarifying existing ideas and reappraising perceptions of events-deepening understanding through the application of a concept-making and testing theories-researching and seeking information-taking and defending a position-solving problems in a variety of ways… and can still be within a structured framework. Take a look at our new inquiry blog  http://inquiryblog.wordpress.com/ and see what you think."

I’ll be recommending it to others!Inquiry learning isn’t something we talk about much at my school but I’ve learnt a lot about it from your blog and it’s something I’m striving towards. In my experience, the typical Grade Two classroom doesn’t involve very much inquiry learning but by using some of the methods you’ve suggested and “planting the seed” with some students they’ve surprised me enormously with what they have achieved and discovered.Keep up your great posts please!!"

The responses  from quite a few of my students were “you explain too much” and “give us more discussion time about a topic” Later on we were doing an activity and I explained it once with visual clues as well but there were a few kids who did not get it. I asked my children what should I do now. The best part was some of my students wanted to give up their time to explain it to their friends- which was great! I was excited."

It is easy to forget what it is like to have your every movement and thought dictated day in and day out.  Students don’t get the opportunity to discover learning for themselves.  We are doing a disservice when we don’t allow students to take the reigns more."

Being aware of this, is certainly making me ‘listen’ to my teaching.  A little voice is beginning to say ‘enough’ let them figure it out for themselves.  Even though this goes without saying, I still need to mention that the kids always need to know we are there for further explanations at all times."

It happened naturally and without planning.Dani: )dani"
