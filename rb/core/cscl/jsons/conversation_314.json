I asked a question. I wondered why the question wasn‚Äôt answered adequately. I disengaged. I thought about effective professional development‚Ä¶ Have you ever been to a PD session like that? (Rhetorical question! I know you have.)Staff at my school spent some time last year developing shared beliefs about learning. Why shouldn‚Äôt these principles apply to teachers‚Äô learning too? 10 ways to ensure effective professional learning‚Ä¶ 1. Teachers need to be responsible¬†for their own learning.¬† To inspire others to learn, you need to be a learner yourself. Actively seek out professional learning opportunities. ¬†Engage with educators via social media.¬†Read blogs. Sign up to Twitter. 2. Differentiate. Don‚Äôt plan whole staff sessions for teachers with different levels of experience and varied needs. Include choice. ¬†"

Trying out new things and failing is not only great for professional learning. It is also a useful lesson for the students. To see the whole process of trying out something new, it not working, and then look at the reasons is the best learning experience. For me this is one of the most powerful ways of learning."

I have recently completed my MA education degree in which my research was on teacher learning ‚Äì  Professional Learning Community and Networked Learning Community ‚Äì what I found was that unless the teacher is totally committed to his/her own learning these learning communities will not benefit anyone especially the students. In my own experience as a teacher, I found that my love of learning has encouraged me to try new ideas, reflect on them, ask for help and share what I have learnt. I am a true believer in teacher learnig using their own styles, that I about to embark on a Ph.D programme of study in which my research would focus on this area of teachedevelopment"

But there are some people who wish they could come and can‚Äôt (because the before-school time clashes with family commitments)‚Ä¶ and others who never come to anything."
