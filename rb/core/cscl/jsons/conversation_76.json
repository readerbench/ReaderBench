It’s too late at the end of the year.’ But here are some questions to ask yourself, as you look back, look within and look forward… 1. What were the most powerful learning experiences in your class this year? Can you describe what made them successful? 2. How do you learn best? What hinders your learning? How can this knowledge help you with future teaching and learning? 3. What do you believe about how learning occurs? What are the conditions for powerful learning? Does your practice align with your beliefs? 4. Who controls the learning in your classes? Do you seek compliance or do you foster student ownership? How will you encourage learner agency? 5. What are you proud of in your teaching or learning and what do you wish you could do better? How might you go about it? Who might support you? 6. What do you wish you could change in your teaching, your learning, your classroom, your school? What small steps could you take towards making it happen? 7. What are your strengths? How might you develop them further? How might you use them to support others in their teaching and learning? 8. What can you learn from your students? What works for them? Have you asked them? What might you change as a result? 9. What excites you? What excites your students? How might you make that part of your teaching and learning? 10. What do you dream of doing? How might you work towards that dream? Who might you share it with? What kind of support do you need?"

When this happens, and you are left to figure things out by yourself, it can be overwhelming, frustrating and will have an adverse effect on one’s career. This happened to me last year, and I’m still dealing with the stress of it."
