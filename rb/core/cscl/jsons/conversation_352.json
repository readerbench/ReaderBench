So it amused me to tweet asking if anyone knew a Spanish song using the preterito imperfecto tense, which Mazz needed for an assignment for her Spanish teaching course. It was retweeted by Yoon, @doremigirl,Â  a music teacher with whom I collaborated last year on a project about celebrations, and soon there was a response from Abby,Â @Sra_Crespo, with an example of a suitable song. One thing led to another and Abby has since communicated a few times with Mazz by email answering a few other queries. When she found out that Mazz volunteers and coordinates the volunteer program at Arte del Mundo Foundation, which promotes literacy and the arts, she offered to send some Spanish resources for the kids who come to the foundationâ€™s interactive library.  Itâ€™s just another example of the power of twitter to foster genuine global connections between people who otherwise would never have met. The foundation is always seeking volunteers, both short and long-term, so if you know anyone who might be interested, please pass on the link to the website. Iâ€™ve blogged before about the library,Â La Biblioteca Interactiva deÂ BaÃ±os,Â its very special atmosphere andÂ the great work that happens there.Â Hereâ€™s theirÂ latestÂ video. I love the excited faces of the kids as they read, play and create â€¦ "

I canâ€™t tell you how many times something similar has happened to me.  The impact on my professional development and global connections cannot be compared to any face to face training that I have participated in.Thank you for continuing to highlight the strength this type of social media has for educators around the globe."

Who knows.. maybe I will be able to travel to Ecuador and visit the school!  Its very exciting to make personal connectionsâ€¦. Nothing is by chance!"
