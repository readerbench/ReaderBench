It reminded me that the ‚Äòopen/closed‚Äô dichotomy applies to me too. Don‚Äôt we all at times think ours is the best perspective, the most efficient way or the right answer? It‚Äôs a reminder to notice‚Ä¶ not just to hear or half-hear, but to listen to and think about what our colleagues are saying. And what our students are saying. And what they are not saying. And what we ourselves are saying‚Ä¶  "

I can be so stubborn about utilizing technology and doing things my own way, that sometimes it is hard to accept other ideas.  What I have learned to do is listen to my intuition about what feels right.  This is great because it allows me to stay focused on what I need to do, but also to be open to other ideas and suggestions.  Since I tutor kids in reading online, my situation is a little different than the average teacher in the classroom, but it is definitely the same concept.  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful picture and wonderful reflection."
