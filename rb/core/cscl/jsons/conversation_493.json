        "text": " One of the most incredible ways to learn and share, without ever attending another boring (or even interesting!) PD session, is to develop an online PLN, personal learning network. Over the past few months I have explored all sorts of possibilities ‘out there’ and am now at a point where it has all come together for me! I have joined some useful nings, subscribe to many informative blogs, have started to write my own blog (!) and am gradually discovering how powerful twitter can be for learning about resources, sharing ideas, seeking help and developing a PLN. This presentation by Mark Wooley might be too much or too little, depending on where you are in your own journey, but it will make you aware of what’s possible! Vodpod videos no longer available. "
