        "text": " I am a â€˜cloud grannyâ€™ , ever appreciative of the miracle of instant global connection which technology affords usâ€¦ Usually when I write about the Granny Cloud, itâ€™s in the context of Mitraâ€™s School in the Cloud. Cloud â€˜Granniesâ€™ all over the world (people of all ages and genders) interact regularly and electronicallyÂ with kids in a range of settings, currently mostly in India, but expanding to other countries too. As these sessions unfold, itâ€™s rewarding to observe the childrenâ€™s confidence grow, English improve and computer skills develop. AndÂ I am also a â€˜realâ€™ Cloud Grannyâ€¦ When my kids were little, we would take photos of their latest achievements, wait till the film was developed and then mail the prints a week later to the grandparents overseas. By the time they were received, the photos were out of date. Today, I wake up to a series of photos and videos of 15 month old Shaiâ€™s latest antics. By mid afternoon in my time zone, I can expect the inevitable â€˜Skype? â€˜ message and I hear him laughing before we can even see each other on the screen. The lovely teacher at Shaiâ€™s day care has set up a private Facebook page, where she posts photos and messages of the daily activities, so parents and (even faraway) grandparents can enjoy seeing the children playing, learning and interacting. Itâ€™s a joy to observe Shaiâ€™s love of animals on the day the animal lady comes and to watch his progress as he gradually learns to join in with the older children in musical and art activities. Soâ€¦ Why is it that, in this day and age of instant communication, schools and parents still expect the kind of report card suited to another era?Â  Why do report cards traditionally go out twice a year, when there are endless ways teachers and learners can, and do, communicate their learning throughout the year? Why do teachers spend great chunks of time reporting in a summative way on a final report, when formative assessment, goals and â€˜feed forwardâ€™ during the year are so much more valuable? Why donâ€™t teachers, parents and learners share the learning via online portfolios, easily accessible throughout the year, demonstrating process, progress and final product, with facility for reflection by students, feedback by parents and â€˜feedforwardâ€™ by teachers? (Let me know if you have a great system, weâ€™re working towards it.) Why donâ€™t learners communicate their learning more with parents and the wider world through the manyÂ possible channels available online? Why do governments and school administrators continue to dictate not just the existence of report cards, but often the format and parameters they should fit? Why donâ€™t we abandon report cards altogether? Now, to prepare for the meeting in which we will review our reports and do our best to make them fit expectations and requirementsâ€¦"

As I said in my blog post: http://kdceci.wordpress.com/2014/11/28/documenting-learning-do-we-need-traditional-reports/ there are a lot of questions that need to be answered by so many if we get out of traditional reports. I am all for the conversation. Letâ€™s keep it going."

        "text": "Here in Victoria, state and Catholic schools have recently been given an opportunity to, once again,  have more input into how they report to parents (I have been witness to the pendulum of central control swinging back and forth all through my teaching career). So this is a question now re-emerging in many of the schools in  which I work.  It is an exciting time. A small parish school not far from where I live is working on how they will utilize a twitter-style, customised app they already use to communicate with parents to provide regular feedback about childrenâ€™s learning. We have discussed the use of class blogs and learning journals as ongoing â€˜learning snapshotsâ€™ parents can viewâ€¦and this works beautifully with what we have already put in place through what the schools calls â€˜learning conversationsâ€™  that replace the old style P-T interviews.  Itâ€™s a good time for many schools to ask themselvesâ€¦â€™if we had FULL choice over what  and how we â€˜reportedâ€™ to parentsâ€¦if we do a total reporting make-overâ€¦what would we do and how would we do it?  What a great whole school, professional inquiryâ€¦ Thanks Edna!"

As a parent I  would like to know my daughterâ€™s progress more often.  I also would like to hear from her teachers more then once a year, better communication would be great.  I like the idea of using Facebook or Blogger to show the progress of the students online."
