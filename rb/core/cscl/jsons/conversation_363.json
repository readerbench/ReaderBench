Your point on encouraging students to discover for themselves reminds me of a recent article in the TES on how some students are not sufficiently resilient.http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6065624. Alan Percy‚Äôs quote:‚ÄúLearning is finding out something that you did not know and struggling with it. It‚Äôs almost as if, if they do not know something immediately they feel as though they are failing.‚Äùstruck a chord. We need to let our students know that struggling is OK, it‚Äôs how you learn."

        "text": "Good succinct post, as always.A couple of points though. I agree that teachers need to be learners to better emphatise with their students and that change, often not easy,  is a necessary part of this. My approach is to remind myself how ‚Äì ie. step out of my comfort zone ‚Äì just as in this post Teacher, be a learner ‚Äì step out of your comfort zone ‚Äì a challenge I posed on myself.I think we could all agree however, that we can‚Äôt always be in a state of  change as may be derived from ‚Äúexperimenting with new ways‚Äù. We can‚Äôt always be experimenting or else we‚Äôll never know what really works and why. I think that I see each of your point above as a spectrum that an effective teacher navigates. For example, teachers must be able to teach to a class as well as cater to individuals, emphasise content as well as reflect on process, etc.So maybe, it should be ‚Äúshift between‚Äù rather than ‚Äúshift from-to‚Äù. Does this make sense? Perhaps this is the bigger challenge."

I have come to understand that I do not need to be too set in a certain way because I might have to adapt to a new teaching style. You said it best when you said that teachers must be learners as well. I couldn‚Äôt agree more. Though this change has to be hard, I know that if it is in the best interest of my students then I will do whatever is necessary.   Technology is such a vital part of childrens lives now that it is only right that we incorporate it into the education system.  As a future teacher, I want to focus on learning and let the kids have some responsibility in teaching themselves and helping in areas that I would usually just do myself. Thank you for this post!!"

I think making the classroom more learner friendly than teacher based is a great idea."

I liked this blog post because you made a comparison between the current way and the new way of teaching. ‚ÄúWorking in a closed classroom to sharing a flexible open environment‚Äù would probably be the hardest for me to do as a teacher. However, I think there are many benefits to being very open in your classroom and flexible. Also, ‚ÄúComfortable thinking to disruptive thinking‚Äù would be another hard one for me. I don‚Äôt like to be out of my comfort zone but you have to do what is best for the students. Some of the points you mentioned in your post are things I am learning in my EDM 310 class and some of my other classes this semester as well. I enjoyed your blog post and it really gave me some insight as to what I am going to have to do when I become a teacher as far as keeping up to date with the newest methods."
