Teachers who are inquirers themselves will provoke curiosity in their learners. If we are thinkers ourselves, we can more effectively build a culture of thinking in our classes. I think if teachers love to learn, they instil a love of learning in their students, without even trying. Do you think you need to love learning to be a teacher? "

You can‚Äôt do that without loving to learn and showing them that passion."

        "text": "I agree that loving learning is important to teaching. However when we talk about loving learning we are often talking about a specific part of that learning that interests us. The real challenge is to take an aspect of learning that doesn‚Äôt interest us and work on becoming a more effective educator in that area. That is one of the reasons that I love teaching primary school kids, (US K12) under 11 years old, as over the last 20 years there has been a constant pressure to continue learning in so many different ways. I also think loving learning is a way of keeping my thought processes flexible. As I age in body the temptation is to become inflexible in my thinking. By constantly realising that I have new things to learn and challenging areas I think I might have ‚Äòcracked‚Äô I hope to remain relevant and flexible.Reading your blog helps this process.Thank you"

What I always find remarkable is the number of teachers who refuse to engage with new technologies or methodologies out of a fear of being made look like they are not ‚Äòexpert‚Äô. At a time when access to knowledge was restricted to a select few it was important for teachers to be ‚Äòexperts‚Äô  however with advancements  in information technology I believe that today it is more important for teachers to be life-long learners than experts."

I think Tyler‚Äôs comment that they ‚Äòloved school‚Äô applies). Their passion for their topic is lost because they don‚Äôt get the kids and the kids know it. I think you need a love of working with children first, then a love of learning second. A love of learning can be lost to the students if there is no teacher/student rapport or relationship in the first place."

I was talking about teachers as learners,  being intellectually curious and being excited by their own learning. That‚Äôs a different thing, isn‚Äôt it?"
