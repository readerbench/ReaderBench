        "text": " I‚Äôve extolled the virtues of Twitter as a tool for connecting, learning and collaborating on many an occasion. A mere ten minutes on Twitter often yields interesting links,¬†book recommendations, thoughtful conversations, opportunities to collaborate, ideas that push one‚Äôs thinking‚Ä¶ Live Twitter chats, usually fast and furious, often add another dimension to the learning, as like minded (or better still, differently minded) educators bounce ideas back and forth. I‚Äôve watched the part Twitter has played in the learning of a young teacher I mentored last year and wondered how educators who don‚Äôt connect via social media can hope to keep up. Sometimes a bit of light Twitter conversation and banter can be fun too! But then there are tweets that add little, if any, value‚Ä¶ 1. Self promotion ‚Äì How great you are, how fabulous your presentation was, the awards you won. (Unless tweeted by someone other than you) 2. Requests to vote for you so that you can win the above mentioned awards. (Doesn‚Äôt canvassing for votes render awards meaningless?) 3. Your minute by minute life updates ‚Äì where you went, what you ate, how far you ran‚Ä¶ 4. Your kids‚Äô minute by minute life updates ‚Äì where they went, what they ate, how far they ran (even if accompanied by cute pictures). 5. Your popularity on Twitter ‚Äì how many new followers you have this week, how many RTs, the extent of your reach (whatever that means). 6. Endless tweets with beautiful pictures and quotes about education, leadership or life. (Rather share your own experience and reflections on these topics) 7. Endless retweets of above mentioned posters with beautiful pictures and quotes‚Ä¶. 8. Infographics that are more graphic and less info, often not proof read, not thought through and not particularly useful. (Looking good isn‚Äôt enough) 9. Lists of 100 best anythings (tools, blogs, ideas, lessons). Who has time to read all that? Did you read all 100 links before you tweeted? 10. This one‚Äôs yours. Anything to add?"

However, to me it is my ‚Äòexperience‚Äô, it is what I have read, what I thought was important. Often I created them myself. Although I try and spend the time to find pictures to match the words, I sometimes just resort to Quozio.com. I wonder then if it is more complicated than ‚Äòpictures‚Äô. Anyway, will continue to reflect."

Innovate! Inspire! #elearning #edtech‚Äù (I just made that one up, but I‚Äôm sure you know what I mean). It‚Äôs not easy, but it is possible.And my current bugbear is tweets that are nothing but a link and a series of hashtags. Some important hashtags are being diluted by people using them for any old thing. They aren‚Äôt fairy dust.Many of the above comments point to the same conclusions you draw: add value, add thoughts, provide context, have conversations, choose hashtags wisely, don‚Äôt be annoying. Don‚Äôt confuse professional and personal profiles.Simple, really, and as Stephanie says it‚Äôs easy to unfollow anyone who doesn‚Äôt actually give us what we need.Twitter is such a powerful tool for professional learning and networking, and we can adjust it to provide the people and information flow that suits us. Magic."
