        "text": " Todayâ€™s collaborative planning session with the Year 5 team is both challenging and invigorating. There are 7 of us in the room and one digital participant.Â The conversation is impassionedÂ and (mostly) focused as we debate, disagree and eventually reach some common understandings. It takes over an hour to ensure our conceptual understandings are sound and to consider the evidence that will demonstrate these understandings in our learners. This part is the crux. It doesnâ€™t bother us that most of the planner is still blank and we have barely thought about theÂ learning engagements. We know (now)Â that ifÂ this part is established,Â we only need a few good provocations, then (almost) sit back and see how the learning unfolds. Observing and listening to the learning, will determine what happensâ€¦ thatâ€™s how inquiry works, so how can you plan it in advance? The unit is about digital citizenship, which could easily fit into any of the PYP trans disciplinary themes and end up looking quite different. We want ours to be in â€˜How We Express Ourselvesâ€™, because, as Silvia Tolisano says, â€˜We are preparing students for a time when what they know is not as importantÂ asÂ what they can do with what they knowâ€¦â€™ It quickly becomes apparent that So how do I tag this post? Is it about planning? Digital citizenship? Inquiry? Concept driven learning? Or is it about change? Â "

Our planning shows us how our thinking shifts when we discuss and reflect and that is why I am comfortable when the children change partners or their topic and their views"
