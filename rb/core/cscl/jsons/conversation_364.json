I was invited this week to share with my ‘leadership team’ (admin.) We looked at what leaders get out of blogs…  We looked at what kids get out of blogs…  We had a quick overview of Twitter and educators worldwide shared what they get out of it.  The plan was to Skype with Patrick Larkin, a principal in Burlington, USA, but it didn’t happen because…  Feedback from my learners… There is a world of people  out there willing to share, learn together and support each other- You are not  alone. This provides the most  wonderful, exciting opportunities to be a part of a learning  community I have spent time reading blogs – I came away feeling inspired, yet a little apprehensive  to write  one. Would love to explore twitter – it was a little bit too fast for me We live in exciting times in  terms of education. I cant wait to begin exploring.   "

We are only now beginning to take this fantastic recourse which is the Internet and mould it into something really powerful that will change lives forever! I find it so encouraging and inspiring to see the work going on in Australia and especially your passion for what is just ‘right’ for you and your pupils! I know that this is just ‘Step 1’ of a process that you have thought long and hard over. I’ll be watching and reading!!Thanks for sharing!"

I hope lots of your teachers have signed up for Twitter now!Leaders can really benefit from blogging and Twitter however, after spending the day reviewing the National Graduate Standards in ICT and I couldn’t help thinking how much tools like blogs and Twitter could be useful for new teachers! What a great tool to start networking and reflecting. Blogs and Twitter provide something for everyone – new teachers, experienced teachers, students and leaders! I know I wouldn’t be the teacher I am without them.Kathleen"
