        "text": " ‚ÄòI used to think‚Ä¶ Now I think‚Äò is one of the most powerful thinking tools (Visible Thinking routines). It allows you to grow, without having to have been wrong. It allows me to develop my ideas, change my practice, increase my understanding, deepen my thinking‚Ä¶ and change my mind. I used to think that the more tightly I kept control, the more efficiently time would be used in the classroom so that more learning could take place. Now I think that the more I let go, the less time will be wasted on management, control, delivery and work‚Ä¶ and the more time there will be for learning. Here‚Äôs an example:Scenario 1The class sits in a circle to discuss an interesting issue. students raise their hands when they have something to share or ask. The teacher ensures everyone has an opportunity to speak. He often rephrases what students say in order to clarify or validate contributions. Many students spend long periods of time listening passively (or not listening at all) while they wait for an opportunity to engage. the teacher spends a fair bit of time asking people to be quiet, pay attention, stop fiddling, raise their hands, not talk while someone else is talking‚Ä¶ Scenario 2The same discussion takes place in small groups and the teacher moves between groups, listening, occasionally asking a key question, listening, requesting clarification or justification, listening. Students practice effective communication by listening and speaking one at a time, but in a natural conversational style, without raising their hands. All the students are more actively involved in the conversation. They are not expected to share details with the whole class, although they might be asked to share only the most interesting or the most contentious point that was raised. There are so many routines and procedures that happen in classrooms, just because that‚Äôs the way they have ‚Äòalways‚Äô been done. How often do kids stand in line waiting for their turn with the teacher?How often does the whole class sit passively (or not!) while the teacher explains something half of the students already know?How often does the teacher expect everyone to wait will she checks who‚Äôs done their homework? Do you ever stop to think about how productively class time is being used for every student‚Äôs learning? Are you ready to change something you do?"

I love the suggestions above on asking question and allowing children to freely respond to these in small groups. The most important job of the teacher or mentor here is to listen keenly and come in with limited but provocative questions and comments to ensure that students are exploring many ideas and perspectives. Questioning, I find is the most powerful tool in getting children to expand their thinking and (think) about their thinking as well."

At the end of last term I did a little bit of ‚Äúdata gathering‚Äù around how many interruptions (visits, intercom notices, phone calls) we had in one week. I wrote down 25 (and I‚Äôm sure I missed some!). At approximately two minutes per interruption by the time the children (and teacher!) regather their train of thought, that‚Äôs a lot of lost learning time each week. I‚Äôm currently trying to rework my class timetable to maximize time as well, making sure that the children are engaged straight after each break. I used to think ten minutes of reading after lunch was a good settling down time, now I think there might be a better way!!"

I appreciate your post for 2 reasons:1)it was reassuring to find like a minded educator, I too, have an aversion to long lines of students and prefer to go to small groups and provide assistance2)you model thinking and learning for your students, which something that I am very passionate about. I always share my learning with my students and often learn along side them!Thanks again for encouraging me to try new methods and not feel the need to change everything at one time!Robyn"

I‚Äôve done a similar thing with A3 paper using the thinking hats.  Students worked in groups writing their coloured hat thoughts.  Then each groups moved on after about 5 minutes adding any new thoughts to the previous groups A3 paper."

Last year, coach would line the girls up and one at a time, each would get a chance to kick the ball into the goal, whilst the others would talk, laugh, wait patiently for a chance to ‚Äúconnect with the ball‚Äù. Her coach this year has enlisted the help of other parents, dividing the girls into smaller groups, with rotating types of skills‚Ä¶ Smaller groups, more direct involvement and engagement, and more ‚Äúconnecting with the ball‚Äù. For the same reason, littlies start out in soccer with ‚Äúsmall sided‚Äù games‚Ä¶ No more than 6 on a team means they all get personal attention and a chance to connect. Lots of parallels between great coaching and great teaching! Thanks. üôÇ"

It is wonderful that you have pointed out the importance of student interaction for effective teaching and learning. I especially like the way you summed up the thought behind, ‚ÄúI used to think‚Ä¶now I think‚Äù. I have always wondered the best way to present this as an argument when I change my mind about something. Most people think that once you make up your mind about something, you can‚Äôt change it. Ridiculous! If you are experiencing, learning, and most of all THINKING, you will MOST DEFINITELY change your mind about some things. Please visit . Again, thanks for sharing another great post!"

As they returned to their seats they worked in a Spelling workbook but no lesson was ever given and the work was never checked.  I thought this was unproductive and have tried to bring the small group experience into my class which I learned while working as a Girl Scout Leader.  We always worked in patrols (small groups) with all individuals within a patrol working together and helping each other achieve whatever goal they were working on. Everyone had the ability to be heard or ask for help. It‚Äôs a great feeling when I walk around my class and listen as my students take charge of their learning. I think using ‚ÄúI used to think‚Ä¶‚Äù and ‚ÄúNow I think‚Ä¶‚Äù will be a great addition within the groups by encouraging the students to think critically and provide information that other students may challenge or support with their own ideas."

Since last year I have been teaching ICT as a specialist teacher and though I often need to demonstrate to the students, I am keen to maximise their learning time and minimise my talking time."
