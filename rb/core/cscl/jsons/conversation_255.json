Shelley Wright has written a a¬†brilliant post¬†about flipping Bloom‚Äôs Taxonomy, complete with wonderful examples of the process in action in Science, Media Studies and English classes. To me, it‚Äôs not so much about flipping as about rethinking altogether.¬†Learning¬†isn‚Äôt linear. It‚Äôs not a step by step, one size fits all process. It doesn‚Äôt go in a sequence from remembering to understanding to¬†analysing‚Ä¶ and finish with creating. And it doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to go in the reverse order either. It depends on the learner and on the situation. ¬†I think it should look more like this‚Ä¶  "

I always thought of it more as reflecting the difficulty of the type of question and the amount of information needed to base that level of question on.  To me, there is a danger at jumping in at the evaluation stage.  I have seen a lot of GT students who blithely evaluate something about which they know nothing and then think that they have done all the work that that question requires.  ‚ÄúWhich is more important X or Y?‚Äù  ‚ÄúY for sure, because it is cool!‚Äù  Said and done."

When Bloom and Co. originally started talking about levels of thinking, I don‚Äôt believe it was their intention for it to become a linear, step-by-step process, but that is how it was interpreted.

I hope you don‚Äôt mind that I reference it like crazy‚Äìboth in my discussions with fellow teachers/admin at my school and on an educational blog to which I contribute (you‚Äôre probably seeing several ‚Äúpingbacks‚Äù from where I reference your articles)!!  As a PYP 5th grade teacher, I was thinking about flipped classrooms‚Äô effect on inquiry-based learning in the classroom, and its potential to increase direct instruction.  On the one hand, flipping the classroom so that instruction takes place at home may provide more room for inquiry learning in class. However, I worry that there‚Äôs not much option for the homework to be anything but direct-instruction as students mainly watch videos.  Do you have any insights on this matter?"
