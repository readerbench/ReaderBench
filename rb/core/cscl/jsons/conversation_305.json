The focus of our exhibition unit this year has been social inequities in the world and the need for action to be taken. The process unfolded something like this… Vodpod videos no longer available."

I’m teaching the little ones – 3-4 year olds for the first time.  Have you got any fresh and exciting ideas what inquiry looks like in the EY?  My children are just beginning to  speak!   I guess my biggest frustration is the lack of english and talking… I always appreciate your posts."

In our class we are learning about technology in the classroom and blogging. I have only been doing this for a few short weeks. You can visit my personal blog at Sara Stewart’s blog or our class blog at EDM310 Class Blog. I enjoyed reading your blog posts. They are very informative and I absolutely loved this collaborated effort by these students. It is great to see their enthusiasm and I know a lot of time, effort and creativity was put into this work. For these students to take what they have learned and displayed it the way they have shows their capabilities to think outside the box. I loved it! I will be summarizing my visits to your blog with a post to my blog on October 9th. In the mean time, I look forward to visiting your blog."

Our goal was to create a broad enough CI so that kids could create their own lines of inquiry or CIs within that, depending on their interests.Last year our exhibition CI was ‘Developing awareness and understanding of inequity empowers us to act’ which is an improved version of our previous one‘Social inequity creates a need for action in the world’By shifting away from the term ‘social inequity’, we created more opportunities for kids to connect with things close to home like bullying and animal cruelty… although others explored a range of areas such as homelessness, water, access to education, disability… etc. We also chose to shift away from ‘people taking action in the world’ to how understanding can empower ME to take action… Hope this helps!Edna"
