        "text": " This is the first in a series of guest posts about learning in different contexts… Guest post by Clive Elsmore I ‘met’ Clive though his fascinating blog about his time volunteering in Sri Lanka. My children have volunteered in developing countries and it’s something I plan to do myself in the future. I’ve blogged about him before, when he spoke to a group of students on Skype about his experiences. This is a cross post from Clive In Sri Lanka. 10 Reasons Why I blog (alternative title by Ed: Learning in Sri Lanka) I started blogging in 2008 when I left my 21-year-life as a “senior electronics design engineer” at EFDA-JET in the UK to become a volunteer teacher at SISP, a small social project for the poor in India.  I wrote CliveInIndia for eighteen months and then continued with CliveInSriLanka when I moved to help improve basic computer literacy amongst teachers in the south of the island. I thought blogging would be a good way to keep in contact with family and friends, to share little adventures, things that amused me, cultural differences, and perhaps to keep contact with people I could discuss ideas with, or ask help from. Another reason was that I’d been warned about volunteer-loneliness so, I thought, blogging might be a possible way of countering the isolation. I was pretty diffident about my writing skills and didn’t want to offend anyone or look a complete wazzock by rabbitting on about stuff I clearly knew nothing about so I kept my first blog for subscribers only – a few friends and family – and sent a sanitised version to my old workplace. It was great at first. People liked what I wrote and said kind words. But, as time passed, interest dwindled. By and large my readers didn’t use an RSS aggregator like Google Reader and so would only look when they remembered. Lives moved on. A few faithful folk continued with me but I began doubting my blogging abilities and purpose.  I decided I should be happy just writing the blog for myself. It was OK – I could keep it as a personal journal of things to look back on.  And, besides, pushing my thoughts out to the world somehow made them a little more real and helped to reflect and clarify them. As for countering loneliness, I’m sure it helped. However, one thing which had bothered me right from the start was the nagging, perhaps conceited, notion that there might be unknown people who’d be interested in what I had to say or might find my anecdotes of life in India useful. Writing for myself was all very well but how much better would it be if others benefitted too? I decided the only way to know for sure was to remove sensitive things and then make the blog public for all to read. When I came to Sri Lanka I was working with a whole new demographic – teachers and not children.  In India the school hadn’t been able to get a decent Internet connection so I just taught with client-based applications.  Here my office was wired and my role was to help local teachers communicate electronically with their overseas counterparts to support the organisation’s programme of cultural exchange. It opened up a world of possibilities. The first thing I did in Sri Lanka was to introduce collaboration through Google docs.  Not only did it win me friends in the organisation but it also helped me organise my own time more effectively by allowing my colleagues to book teachers into a Google spreadsheet timetable. The pressure was on to efficiently produce a curriculum and learning materials. I felt I needed to tap into the online community so I subscribed to blogs and got going with Twitter. (I haven’t exploited this fully yet – I still wonder if there might be people willing to help me develop a general learning resource for teachers or volunteers in developing countries.)  I was very fortunate to quickly find people who went out of their way to help me grow my Personal Learning Network. This had an unexpectedly positive impact on my blog hits. Unexpected because I didn’t think my posts as an amateur would be of much interest to any qualified teachers, and because I was trying to introduce local teachers to Web 1.0 when Western teachers were talking Web 2.0 minimum. But feedback from a few teachers and children has informed me that some of my photos have helped kids in their studies, and some of my tales have been of interest to new readers.  This is great encouragement! So there you have it.  Ten reasons why I blog:"

However, there’s another blogger who writes 100 times better than me – see Paul Goodchild’s blog http://paulgoodchild.net/blog/  – he writes intelligently and reflectively, often humorously and sometimes intimately.  He seems a ‘natural’ to me and I’d recommend you take a look.Best wishes,Clive"

I think a lot of bloggers are under the false assumption that no one outside of family, friends, and coworkers will care to read our blogs.  I felt the same when I began my blog, I started it for my coworkers.  I have come to realize that if I was blogging for a reason (even if they were my own) that others would be seeking out a blog that addressed a specific need.  In your case, I’m sure that you would have enjoyed coming across a blog that was a narrative of someone volunteering the way that you were, like kindred spirits.  They say that in this world there is someone for everyone (usually referring to marriage), I think the same is true in the blogging world.  There are readers for everyone!"

That’s one thing about Ed’s kind offer of this guest post – it gives my blog more visibility, so increasing the chances of it being discovered by people who might like it.  I think that a blog’s readership will also be dynamic, some people will naturally come and go, over time.  I’m happy with that – it’s how I myself behave. It would be nice to know that there are a few other kindred spirits doing what I’m doing, but I haven’t come across too many. However, I have met folk who are at least with me in spirit and that’s a great start!Clive"
