Here’s the kind of responses that came from teachers in our Learning Team Leaders group… The clip elicited different responses from 6th grade students, asked to make connections with themselves and their learning… You can read the whole delightful conversation, including responses from kids in other schools, here. (It highlights the possibilities of blogging as a tool for authentic reading, writing and conversation beyond the classroom walls, but that’s another story!) Often the best clips to stimulate thinking are not directly related to the subject at hand and can be used in a range of contexts. Do you have any other ideas for using this one? Have you come across any great, short videos that provoke thinking and inspire conversation?"

        "text": "Hi EdnaI love using little clips and pictures as a way to provoke thinking especially on qualities related to the learner profile. It’s a way to focus the kids and I on the big picture of what we are trying to achieve in the classroom.  In fact every Friday I try to tie up the learning and conversations that the class has had with some sort of big idea. We call it our big idea Friday.  . Often I find the best clips are ones that show up in my twitter feed almost serendipitously as I’m inquiring about a conversation or moment in class. Some of my favourites are the TMB Panyee FC , connected the interview that Jon Stewart did with Malala Yousafzai, Playing to your strengths"
