        "text": " “We need to educate the parents.” I’ve heard that statement three times in the past week alone. Once was while discussing the purpose of student portfolios. The second was in the context of making our PYP exhibition more student led, focusing more on the learning than the presentation. The third related to student led conferences. Apparently most parents want time to discuss their children’s learning without the learner present. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not blaming the parents. They need to be partners in their children’s learning and we need to find ways to make this possible and meaningful. But many parents base their opinions on the only model of education with which they are familiar… their own schooling. Even if they are young parents, I’d like to hope schooling has changed since they went to school. 10 things I think (some) parents should unlearn… 1.  Learning is best measured by a letter or a number. 2. Product is more important than process and progress. 3. Children need to be protected from any kind of failure. 4. The internet  is dangerous for children. 5. Parents and teachers should discuss students without the learner present. 6. Homework is an essential part of learning. 7. The school is responsible for the child’s entire education. 8. Your child’s perspective is the only one. 9. Learning looks the same as when you went to school. 1o. Focus on (and fix) your child’s shortcomings, rather than their successes. I won’t elaborate at the moment, as I’d rather have your input. As a teacher and/or a parent, which ones do you agree with? Disagree? Challenge? Question? One of the most visited posts on this blog was 10 things TEACHERS should  unlearn. Take a look at that one too.  It was written two years ago – Does it need an update?"

I am finding it increasingly more effective to offer a number of choices about home learning, rather than any traditional forms.  I hope that the internet will be our saviour here.  With Wonderopolis, blogs, writers clubs, mathletics et al, I’m leaning towards letting the kids choose what they do at home.  The challenge is ensuring engagement and balance…..Great list – has me thinking."

        "text": "Thanks for the invitation to challenge as that I must. apart from a few points, most of the points are valid….as the opposite end of a spectrum, yes a spectrum, because life is rarely black and white.point 1 – there are companies (big ones) that boil down performance to a number, and remuneration can be affected accordingly. Some parents know this, too. It may be unfair and unrealistic to do so but it definitely exist.point 2 – product can be really important, sometimes at the expense of process and progress. For example, in construction, projects could be delayed or change their processes to ensure that the product (say bridge) meets the required quality (think safety, for example).point 3 – some children do need protection, perhaps not all the time, but when they are particularly vulnerable. I know at least 2 teens who are in this space right now (very sad).point 4 – there are dangers with the internet, even for adults….sometimes, not entirely our own fault.point 5 – a parent of a troubled teen told me she’d rather not have her son around on parent-teacher nights so he didn’t have to hear “what’s wrong with him” consecutively. point 6 – there are households where homework is the only window for parents into their child’s learning. etcI think the main theme is that “it depends” or the context. People are so complex – and that makes us interesting – and unraveling this complexity takes time and effort.  so for me, it’s not about unlearning the above as if they’re bad habits but to learn that these are true (or false) depending on the context…usually.Oh, to discuss this face-to-face!!!  xox"

I do agree with Malyn though that sometimes these points are contextual.I don’t agree with homework for the sake of it but, at least for pur upper primary students, I think that certain homework serves a purpose. It can instigate a discussion with parents or other members of the family, it can allow the student to teach their parents or siblings a new skill, or consider an idea or opinion, or it can serve as a way for some students to investigate a variety of strategies to help with time management.We have some wonderful parents who are very supportive of their child’s learning but who can also seriously question the use of technology, collaboration with others, use of blogging etc, and, I think you’re right, much of this is related to the fact that they learned in a different way and they were successful with that model.Sorry for rambling!"

What I’d now like to see is some of these converted to the positive where necessary, together with a brief explanation of why they need to be said. For example, to make the generalised statement that the internet is not dangerous for children is a bit like saying that handling loaded guns is not dangerous for children. It depends on how children are educated in handling them – or the internet. Does it mean supervised or not, and if so, to what extent? I have seen a number of children shattered by what they came across on the net. Seriously damaged.Don’t get me wrong. I think all of them, with explanation where required, make very good sense."

For example, there may be some situations where it would be best not to have the student present for parent-teacher meetings.  Like Malyn, I also like the idea of exploring the validity of these statements (or not) within context rather than the broad suggestion of “unlearning” or discarding per se.And finally 🙂  Whether there is agreement about each point in the list or not, another question/next step would be about how a teacher or school would go about providing opportunities for parents to explore and experience what the alternatives would be or look like.  How can we help them gain confidence in a different model….and what is the willingness to do that for each?Hope my ramble helps in some way!"

I agree with her to some extent-if the activity is meaningful however I feel that all too often homework is given because its become a parent’s expectation. Id like to see no homework.

I agree with most of the things parents must unlearn (both as a parent and as an educator of young children). The one that I think is difficult is #8 ‘Your child’s perspective is the only one’. Having worked for over 10 years in early care and education I know that this doesn’t go away. As a parent I have been guilty of the same thing. I think here an educator must communicate with parents in a way that a parent will feel that you care tremendously for their child’s perspective while explaining others. This is a tough one. #6: Having been educated in a rigid education system in India, I do feel (as a parent) that some of the rigor is missing from schools. I think the question is not ‘whether there should be homework’ but ‘what types of exerices and assignments would be great for children to do at home as a way of reflecting and extending what they learned at home.It saddens me to see my 3rd grader sit doing worksheets that are not challenging and don’t extend her thinking in anyway. I struggle as a parent because I don’t want to say ‘don’t do your homework’ but I know its a waste of her time!‘ Great post! I will now read the one about ‘what teachers need to unlearn’."

Class time — at least in high school — isn’t enough, but if well-designed it can be the jumping-off point for appropriate effort outside of the class. Although there certainly can be too much homework, too LITTLE expectation for meaningful, independent work is an abrogation of our responsibility as educators to challenge kids."

I think the pressure should be taken off and parents given more flexibility over the time spent on it, however, I do think it helps children get to that stage of fluency and comfort with the material sooner. In high school it helps to do the practice necessary at home in order to free up contact time for learning new things and discussion, etc… Also there aren’t many jobs involving responsibility and with good pay that don’t come with homework for your whole career. So it’s a good habit to learn."

When you couple this problem with our North American need to be helicopter parents, hovering over every more our children make, we greatly inhibit our children’s ability to develop the 21st century skills they need to  navigate life on their own.  How can our children develop sound learning and innovation skills, digital literacy skills, or career and life skills, if as parents, we are unwilling to let them actively participate in their learning, take risks, make mistakes, manage their own time, and discover their own passions and gifts?  As teachers we also need to step back and let our students explore, question, stumble and learn in an environment that might look and feel a little different from the one we have become comfortable and accustomed too.  I like the motto of the Singapore Education system that I read recently, “Teach less, learn more”."

Realistically, the world is such a different place today than what it was 25-35 years ago. My oldest child was fortunate enough to be accepted into a gifted class for grades 3-6. What appealed to me most about the program was the learing style: core subjects such as math and reading were student led and they could test out of areas, science and social studies were group units that the entires class reviewed and worked on for upto 6 weeks. Students learned to dive into the subject and really embrace what they were learning, it was not the typical text book/work book scenario. It was the learning model that excited me most. They rarely ever had daily homework unless it was a large project, even then it was six weeks, not one week.I would love as a PTO parent to be able to hold workshops that discuss these very topics. We do need to re-learn about schooling. We can’t expect our teachers to be the only ones keeping up with the technological times!"

I find myself continually doing it – however,  neither my husband or I were educated in the USA – for us, the differences are huge, and at times quite disturbing.I do think that as parents we are required to “be in charge” of the education our children receive. I feel strongly that children have no place in a parent/teacher discussion – certainly in the younger grades.I do think homework is necessary, although I do think a lot of what comes home, is not of great value. I believe it teaches children self discipline, something they’ll need in the outside world.I agree whole heartedly with the thought that success is not measured by a number on a piece of paper, however, our schools teach to the very concept, that that number or letter is all important (State Testing is evidence of this). I am also continually horrified at the number of parents (my closest friends fall into this group), who threaten and punish their children when grades upward of 85% are not attained …… my children know that we expect them to do their best – if that best is only a C, then that’s OK …………… I haven’t found this to be the norm here in the US. Sadly a great number of parents in my experience, need to realize that not every child is cut out to be an Einstein,i think the criteria of a good education is that, we have well rounded, self disciplined, confident children, who know the value of hard work, graduate from High School."
