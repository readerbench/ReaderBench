        "text": " Today’s #edchat topic was:  ‘How do we ensure those without privilege have equal access to quality education and opportunity?’  Many felt that access to technology was the key. But there were just as many tweets expressing the opinion that providing access to technology is not as important as providing good teachers. I usually agree with the latter and have blogged several times about learning being the driver and technology just the tool. But then I work in a privileged school. I confess that I found my thoughts somewhat confused and I left the #edchat conversation in the middle to process further. I’m still thinking… Does access to education mean access to technology? Does access to technology mean access to education? Meanwhile, I’d like to repost the following for those who’re unfamiliar with it, to provoke some further thought. I first posted it in November when this blog had about 12 readers! Have you heard of the inspirational hole-in-the-wall project ?  Several years ago, a computer scientist, Dr. Sugata Mitra, had an idea. What would happen if he could provide disadvantaged children with free, unlimited access to computers and the internet?  He launched what came to be known as the hole in the wall experiment. Listen to this fascinating TED talk from 2007 , in which Sugata Mitra talks about the project and asks what else children can teach themselves!   "

Dr. Sugata Mitra has introduced interesting data on technology, children, and learning. I am fascinated with the power of what children can do if they have access to technology. Thank you for bringing Hole in the Wall Project to my attention. Now, it is time for me to do more research on children, technology, and learning."
