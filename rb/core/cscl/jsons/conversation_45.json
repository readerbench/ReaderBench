        "text": " When I was 12, there was a gang leader in my class. She was clever, pretty and powerful and if you weren’t in her group, you were no-one. Her followers were highly trained in the art of excluding others and making them feel worthless. Not much has changed in the world of school, but bullying has been amplified by social media. I can only imagine what life for us nobodies would have been like, if  the powerful leader and her gang had been able to post photos of us on Snapchat and multiply the nastiness via a Whatsapp group from which we were excluded.  It’s only too easy to lament the tragedy of it all, blame the children, their parents, ourselves and especially technology. Instead we need to: Commit to the change we want to see. Are we prepared to take action? What’s a good name for the project? – Platform Articulate the desired outcome in detail.  Imagine the culture we’d like to cultivate. What will it look like? What will be noticeable?  What will others see? – Future Perfect Reflect on where we are now. What would take us up a notch or two? What would the first tiny signs of progress be?  – Scale Notice what is already happening. Gather data from kids, teachers and parents. What’s going well? What successes have there been? How were they achieved? – Counters Decide what action to take.  What small steps will we take? What specific and concrete steps will propel us forward? – Small Actions  We might name our project ‘ Increasing a culture of kindness’. Do you have ideas to share? What’s working at your school? Thanks @annettegci. You can see the immediate impact of your Solution Focus Master Class extending beyond coaching… Solution focus tools – Mark McKergrow"

It is all about creating that foundation of a caring culture and having everyone have similar understandings of “At this school we…” Drip Drip Drip, and never give up!"

        "text": "In our school the students led a ‘compassion project’ which focused on identifying & recoding compassionate acts. The project was mostly led by students in grade 4 who explored the layers of compassion as part of ‘who we are’. This invoked ripples of kindness and compassionate acts across the school. It was great to see some real authentic action and the positive emotions produced by it."

Palacio which looks at the different perspectives of people involved with August who has facial abnormalities. Teaching our student’s to reflect on what it is like to be on “the other side” is just a small step towards building empathy in our schools. Good luck!"
