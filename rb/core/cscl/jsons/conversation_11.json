She shares an approach she took with her teachers and, when I ask if I can steal it, she tells me to adapt and improve on it and then blog about it so that she can steal it back. The biography of an idea ðŸ™‚ The enhanced version of the IB Primary Years Program has detailed, well researched articles on all areas of the program, divided into sections: The Learner, Learning and Teaching and The Learning Community. I like the title â€˜Principles into Practiceâ€™ which fits with our approach to the self study we are currently (perpetually, actually) undertaking. â€˜How will we bring the beliefs of the PYP to life?â€™ rather than â€˜How will we ensure we comply with the standards and practices?â€™ In last nightâ€™s session, teachers considered the headings of the sections and talked about which topics they are most familiar with and which they know least aboutâ€¦  Next, they each chose a section to inquire into and spent some time reading the articles and reflecting, individually, in pairs or groups, using a thinking routine adapted from Project Zero. Connect: What connections can you make to current practice in our school? Extend: How was your thinking extended? Whatâ€™s new for you here? Explore: What might we explore further? (individually and as a school) The outcome: So simple. So much data for moving forwardâ€¦"
