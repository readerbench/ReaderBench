        "text": " As a veteran educator, I remember how I used to approach setting up my classroom, years ago. I thought more about the ‘what‘ and the ‘how‘ than the ‘why‘… In preparation for the new school year, we start today’s session in groups, discussing our learning principles and unpacking how they might be supported by the learning environment. It’s all about the ‘why‘. The teachers keep our beliefs about learning in mind, as they purposefully create engaging learning spaces.  We’ve come a long way. Walls have been (physically or metaphorically) taken down to enhance collaboration. The conversation is thoughtful and focused, as intentional learning spaces are established. New ways of thinking replace the old, as teachers consider what furniture to remove, allowing for more flexibility to support diverse learners and different kinds of learning. Everyone is grateful for the time allotted to make this a meaningful undertaking. Here are some ‘six word stories’ the teachers created to express their thoughts about the learning environment. and this one – Don’t be fooled by its simplicity. It indicates a shift from the one-size-fits-all approach, in which every child had a permanent seat at a table (see previous post re compliance!), reflecting instead a growing understanding of student-centred learning. It allows for student choice and voice, for different possibilities and new opportunities…."

We began our session at the campus you visited  with  a thinking routine. “I used to think and now I think” and that was a celebration of how our thinking and attitudes have changed. I think that dogged persistence and time and support are essential elements in change."

        "text": "The question of why is very important to a instructor. I agree with you Ms. Sackson about replacing the new way of thinking with the old way. You were also correct about creating engaging learning spaces. Involving yourself in a new setting of teaching can be a great task at hand. Six Word Stories were a great creation for the learning environment. Stimulating space to share an learn is very essential to how a child can engage in his or her activity at school. When children work together and share their thoughts, it makes it very engaging as a class period."
