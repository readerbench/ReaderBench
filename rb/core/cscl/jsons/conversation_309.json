Aim: Create a film to express the essence of the social inequity that you have explored for your personal inquiry. Process: Vodpod videos no longer available.  Here’s an example of what kids can create in just a few hours:  Vodpod videos no longer available. Observations:  "

As someone who has taught film to kids 4-18, and went to college for it… I would have to say without much knowledge of the process, this was outstanding and probably more engaging, meaningful and long lasting then writing a paper or having a teacher led discussion! I’m always open to lend a skype hand… if they would like some help!thanks for sharing this!David"

I love how your teacher, you, the teacher librarian and the students were all so motivated to go forward and give the filming idea a try.  There is no dobut in my mind that filming and editing is one of the most powerful ways that students can express their understanding and learning in a school/ world context.  What I would like to highlight is that you had a PURPOSE and a PLAN in mind and shared with the students before you started.  These simple but effective elments of technology integration is one of the biggest reasons why you and your students are consistently so successful in making technology, 21st century skills and inquiry work in your school.  WAY TO GO!"

I think that similar videos may even have more of an impact than those with a lot of action and speech.  <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/27244727&quot; This  is a similar video, from a crew with little more experience, that really emphasizes the same idea.  It not only taught the kids more about filmmaking, but I’m hope also taught them more about what it feels like to be hungry or living in poverty.  It would be great if they can continue to use these skills in future projects, whether it is directly related to filmmaking or not.A link to my <a href=\"http://reynoldsjennaedm310.blogspot.com/&quot; blog put together for a college course focused on technology in the classroom."
