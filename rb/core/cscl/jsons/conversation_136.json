        "text": " Does every meeting in your school relate to or result in learning?If not, is the meeting worth having? Does every lesson in your classroom contribute to meaningful learning, rather than completion of work?If not, is the lesson worth having? So far, I’ve read Chapter 1 of ‘Meeting Wise’ by Kathryn Parker Boudett and Elizabeth City, and I’m taken with it, right from the first two questions, with which I totally identify… ‘Have you ever had to sit through a whole hour when you felt like the substance of the meeting could have been handled in five minutes?’ and ‘Have you planned a thoughtful meeting only to have it derailed by a couple of rogues participants who have their own agendas?’ The authors highlight four aspects for careful consideration when planning successful meetings: PurposeProcessPreparationPacing The meeting checklist they suggest includes twelve probing questions relating to the above, of which I have selected ten. The questions are theirs, the applications to the classroom are mine: 1. Have we identified clear and important meeting objectives that contribute to the goal of improving learning?Do we know the purpose of every learning engagement in our classroom? Do the students? Is every single thing that happens in your learning space thoughtful and international? 2. Have we established the connection between the work of this and other meetings in the series?Is it clear how today’s learning relates to other learning that has and will take place? Do students have opportunities to make connections with prior learning, construct meaning and apply learning in different contexts? 3 Have we incorporated feedback from previous meetings? Do you seek feedback from your students about what they got out of learning experiences? Do you observe and listen to the learning and plan responsively? 4. Have we chosen challenging activities that advance the meeting objectives and engage all participants? Are the learning engagements challenging, purposeful and engaging? Will they advance not just knowledge, but the growth of skills and attitudes that will matter in future learning? 5. Have we built in time to identify and commit to next steps?Have we provided learners with time for thoughtful reflection and consideration of how to take their learning forward? Have we offered meaningful feedback, or rather  feed forward that might guide them? 6. Have we built in time for assessment of what worked and what didn’t in the meeting?I’m fond of the saying ‘everything is an assessment’. Have we observed and listened thoughtfully to what the learners say (and don’t say) as evidence of the development of skills and understanding? Have we identified misconceptions and highlighted further needs? 7. Have we gathered or developed materials that will help to focus and advance the meeting objectives?Have we planned and developed provocations that will provoke thinking and engage learners with the intended issues, concepts and beyond? Have we carefully thought about the desired understandings then encouraged creative ways for students to embark on their own journeys to get to them? 8. Have we put time allocations to each activity on the agenda?If you plan what will happen throughout your lessons, this one will make sense to you. As an inquiry teacher, it doesn’t apply in my context! We need to be ready to abandon the plan, if the learning takes us in a new direction. We need to plan in response to the learning. 9. Have we ensured that we will address the primary objective early in the meeting? Do we ensure we don’t waste time on activities that won’t lead to learning, but get right into the learning from the start? Can we take the role, hand out the books etc in a more efficient manner that doesn’t waste prime learning time? Have you read ‘The 5 Minute Teacher’ in which Mark Barnes highlights the idea of talking less and letting the learning happen? 10. Is it realistic that we could get through our agenda in the time allocated?Have we filled a lesson plan with activities or have we allowed time to let the learning unfold? Will students be so busy competing tasks, they don’t have time to construct meaning? Have we ensured there will be time for depth of understanding?"

What worked well and what didn’t? I’m convinced that if I model asking this question regularly it will give permission for others to examine their own practice more closely. I always enjoy your blogging. Thanks.Cameron"

I am starting to see the importance of having a great lesson plan and being ready for when learning takes us in a new direction. All of the questions that were asked are things that I need to know more about and I will more than likely be reading the book you mentioned. It’s great that teaching is leaning more towards problem solving and thinking about a situation, other than having a huge work load to deal with. It definitely was not like that when I was a child in school."
