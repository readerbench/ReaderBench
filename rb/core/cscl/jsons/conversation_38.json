        "text": " Learning isn’t linear. Consider your own learning… How do a range of separate experiences contribute to the development of your understanding? How does that understanding deepen, the more you engage with the same conceptual ideas in different contexts? So, why had we historically planned the order of our units of inquiry in a linear way? (When would one unit end and the next unit begin? How many weeks would we need to devote to each? What dates would work best?) The time had come to view the process in a different way. We started from the most beautiful questions that drive change – ‘Why?’ ‘What if?’ and ‘How might we?’ Why should curriculum be viewed as linear? What if we put the child at the centre and considered the learning in a more wholistic way? How might we approach the big picture through the lens of transferable concepts, rather than the calendar? In each team meeting, we began by writing the ‘related concepts’ (PYP terminology for the big transferable ideas) in each unit on individual sticky notes and arranging them to allow us a visual perspective on the learning as a whole, then underlining the concepts that are most transferable.  This simple activity raised a number of insights, such as: Approaching the exercise conceptually, visually, in a non linear way led teachers very quickly to valuable conclusions about the big picture of learning – which units would flow on most logically from each other, which units might be best run concurrently and which units lend themselves to ongoing learning, woven throughout the year. Some examples of ongoing, concurrent or even year-long, units of inquiry: A Prep unit, exploring reading and writing as an inquiry. Central Idea: We can receive and communicate meaning through symbols.  Lines of inquiry: A Year 5 unit which, after the initial provocation and exploration, will continue as a Genius Hour project, with learners pursuing their own inquiries and action. Central Idea: Ideas inspire possibilities for action. Lines of inquiry: And our whole school, year-long central idea: Our choices define who we are as individuals and as a community, with different lines of inquiry at each year level, such as: Prep (self) Year 3 (individual and community) Year 6 (personal, local and global) Learning isn’t linear…"

        "text": "Hi Edna. A great post and thank you for sharing your ideas. I really like the idea of a whole school unit, with each grade level taking on different lines of inquiry suitable for them. I think this has more benefits than just at surface level, such as students developing a stronger conceptual understanding by continuing a unit each year. Also, for all teachers on staff to collaborate on one central idea, sharing learning from the units and having a continual connection with their students learning. "
