Our Learning Team Leaders, one from each grade level and a couple from specific learning areas, gather for our weekly meeting. With thoughtfully planned Meeting Wise agendas, clear objectives and protocols in place for everyone to have a voice, these meetings are a valuable space for collaboration, shared learning, community building, analysis of ideas and collective problem solving. The objective of today‚Äôs meeting is to share the latest updates on the PYP review. Responses to the check-in question include the fact that it is purposeful and relevant, the attitudes it fosters, the culture it creates, the value placed on learner agency, the common language and understandings, inquiry as a stance, the concept driven approach, encouragement of ownership and action. While all have access to the whole document, for the purpose of this meeting each participant receives one item from the review to read and consider. We then each share the gist of that particular change, using the ‚Äòplus, minus, interesting‚Äô protocol, followed by discussion and questions. This turns out to be a successful approach, encouraging everyone to engage with the big ideas and become familiar with the coming changes, while providing an opportunity to reflect on our growth as a learning community over time. We finish with insights and puzzles: It‚Äôs satisfying to note the understanding, passion and pride with which these educators talk about what has become, for us, not just a way of learning, but a way of being."

I have gone through the phases of acceptance with this visual‚Ä¶Or, better put‚Ä¶‚Äôexcept stance.‚Äô I like this, EXCEPT for that! I started with denial and went on from there. As an educator and visual artist, I now see this as an opportunity to collaborate with the image. When collaborating people, I understand that all ideas are valuable and can lead to a brilliant outcome without them coming initially from my comfort zone. For now, I will take a deep breath, appreciate, listen, read, talk and digest. I think I am ready for it. :0)"
