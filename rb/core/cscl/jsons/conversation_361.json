        "text": " Blogging is relatively easy. You sit in your own quiet space and record your thoughts in writing. You might have readers or you might not and, if you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôll never be able to predict which posts will be popular. Sometimes the ones that are most important to you will attract the fewest readers and the most unexpected posts will draw streams of comments and debate. But that‚Äôs ok‚Ä¶ I write for myself as much as for anyone else. It‚Äôs a great place to process my thinking and share examples of great learning. Presenting is another story. You can see the responses of the audience as you speak, the ‚Äòreal you‚Äô is visible to all and you don‚Äôt get an opportunity to rewrite if it doesn‚Äôt turn out well.¬†Next week I‚Äôll be presenting at the¬†IB Asia Pacific Conference and it‚Äôll be my first presentation outside my own school, so more than a little nerve wracking. The title is ‚ÄòKids Talking to Kids‚Äô and here‚Äôs the blurb: What could be more engaging than kids talking to kids across the world? What better way to encourage intercultural understanding and international-mindedness? The session will include examples of ¬†collaborations which have enabled the flattening of classroom walls, allowing students to learn from and with people around the world. It will explore the ways learning can be enhanced through such interactions. It will highlight what we have learned, challenges and successes, and share effective ways such connections can be established. I‚Äôm not an expert. There are many wonderful educators out there who have been doing this for longer and more successfully than I have. I hope to continue to be inspired by them and perhaps, in turn, to inspire those who haven‚Äôt yet taken the first step. By chance I was invited by Anne Mirtschin to present on the same topic in Elluminate as part of the¬†Tech Talk Tuesday series of webinars, so I‚Äôve chosen to do it in the same week for practice. I‚Äôve participated in these sessions a few times , the atmosphere is relaxed and Anne is very supportive and encouraging. The session is at 4pm (Australia time) on Tuesday 15th March (world times here) and here‚Äôs the Elluminate session link in case any of you want to log in and join us. Hopefully we‚Äôll all make some new connections and set up future possible collaborations.  "

        "text": "What a great opportunity Edna! I mean that not just for you but for the people you will be presenting to. Your work and perspectives have been great and I am sure has tonnes to do with why you will be in presenter‚Äôs shoes.  With all your experience and thoughts, you just have to be yourself and the rest will be stellar.  On another note, this post makes me also think of our students.  So many of them are embracing technology and social media in our classrooms (blogging, twitter, twiducate, edmodo, etc) in addition to their personal time but how much has that detracted from their interpersonal (face-to-face) skills?  You point out that presenting in person is ‚Äúanother story‚Äù  and it totally is!  I  just saw a news piece on the local tv station and it quotes a teacher saying that social media allows students who are shy to participate in the class more.  As I do completely agree with that as a fellow educator, I just don‚Äôt want to see the art (and practice) of speaking to groups/presenting, etc fall too much by the wayside that the challenge to do it becomes even bigger than it already is.  Thanks for another great post Edna and best of luck at YOUR presentation!"

I have every confidence that you will do a wonderful job, as your passion and commitment will shine through, regardless of how nervous you are. I wil try to catch your elluminate presentation though. Aren‚Äôt we lucky to have people like Anne who provide us with such opportunities and the support necessary?"
