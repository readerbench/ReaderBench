It’s a collaborative problem solving tool for raising issues and coming up with possible solutions. Here’s an example of one which my team created last year to discuss  potential issues in using Solvr. (Feel free to add to it, to see how Solvr works.) Using it in class was fun, the kids were engaged and everyone participated in the discussion, even the ones who usually have less to say in class conversation. By whatedsaid | View this Toon at ToonDoo | Create your own Toon I often ask my students to jot down their thoughts in the last couple of minutes of a lesson, in the form of feedback for me or a reflection for themselves. Here’s what they thought of the Solvr learning experience: That probably gives you enough reasons to try using this tool…   I have nothing to add!  "
