        "text": " What do these two words mean? Everyone in the class knows what â€˜createâ€™ means but only a few are familiar with the word â€˜consumeâ€™. mostly in the context of eating, although one girl says â€˜Itâ€™s when you take something in, for instance informationâ€™. We use breakfast as our example and they get the idea that making the eggs could be seen as creating and eating them as consuming. WeÂ deliberately do not use a dictionary, so that they construct meaning for themselves, rather than narrow down their understanding with a fixed definition at the start. In groups, the children then brainstorm all the things they do in a day, making sure every item includes a verb â€“ watch TV, play Minecraft, eat lunch, write a storyâ€¦  Using two colours, they highlight which of these are consuming and which are creating.Â The conversations are rich, as they build their understanding and discover that itâ€™s not either/or, that some are both and some are neitherâ€¦ maybe. Which of their daily activities are digital? In new groups, they now brainstorm their digital activities, taking care to include verbs, so that, for instance, â€™emailâ€™ becomes â€˜read emailâ€™ and â€˜write emailâ€™â€¦ They are already discussing consuming vs creating before we even ask the question. They are totally engaged and, apart from building their understanding of the desired concepts, so many trans-disciplinary skills are evident â€“ communication, thinking and social skills â€“ and, quite incidentally, a host of outcomes from the English scope and sequence. At the end they write down what they understand about creating and consuming nowâ€¦  Theyâ€™re clearly ready to move ahead in developing the desired conceptual understandings in this unit of inquiryâ€¦ Reflection I donâ€™t think critically about what I post online. Â  Â  I choose appropriate techniques to communicate creatively and Â effectively online and can give examples. Responsibility (action) Connection Our learners are gearing up to connect with kids in other parts of Australia as well as India, Japan, Thailand, New Zealand, Canada and other countries via Skype, Twitter and blogs. And they are already asking a range of interesting questions into which they might inquire! In addition to refining this unit of inquiry with the Year 5 teachers at my school, Iâ€™ll be leading an IB workshop on Digital Citizenship in Melbourne in May, so feedback, resources, ideas and other perspectives are invited. Â Please leave a comment!"

I think there are many others who would benefit from similar learning. I am also very interested in your criteria for critical thinking and responsibility. At the moment I am writing a series of posts on my blog about these same issues. Iâ€™ll be referring to this article when I post the next in the series. Thanks for this great work."
