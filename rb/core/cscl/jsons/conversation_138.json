        "text": " Creating shared iPad photo streams was a brainwave â€“ so simple and obvious, yet so effective! They provide a space to gather evidence of learning, share practice and celebrate the learning taking place across the three campuses of our school. Itâ€™s an opportunity for members of our learning community to find out whatâ€™s happening in other grade levels, the kitchen garden, the art and music roomsâ€¦Â Weâ€™re encouraging more comments and conversation around whatâ€™s posted to make this even more meaningful. Weâ€™ve come a long way in the past few years in terms of flattening classroom walls and connecting with the world. Today, the images I see in our shared photo streams suggest new possibilitiesâ€¦ Our art teacher posted a series of beautiful artworks by our 5 year olds. Beyond sending them home to be stuck on the fridgeâ€¦Â imagine if photographs of these creations were published in an online book, along with captions written by the children and photos of them at work creating them?  There is some powerful thinking happening in Year 6 as their awareness of inequity is raised. Imagine if they were collaborating with learners globally, sharing their tough questions, exploring different perspectives, comparing and contrasting action taken in different countries and deepening their understanding together.  Year 5 learners revisited and reflected on their class agreement, halfway through the school year. What if they compared their agreements with those established by classes in other parts of the world? Imagine how communicating with other classes, discussing commonalities and differences might heighten awareness and strengthen learning communities within and beyond their own classrooms.  I love the photos from the Year 1 inquiry into how we express oursÂ ideas and feelings through performance. Imagine if these performances were filmed and posted online for children in other places to see and ourÂ children received feedback from all over the world.  And, as I was writing this post, a fresh idea just struck me. Imagine ifÂ two or more classes of similar age in different parts of the world created a shared photo streamÂ andÂ posted images, shared learning experiences and wrote comments to each other.Â Are you in?! Our access to digital technologies make all of this, not just possible, but easy. Just imagineâ€¦ and then we can make it happen."

I have done two global PBLs in the past two years using the Global Classrooms and it has been an incredible experience. This year our fifth grade will create an online magazine about revolutions and how they start, causes and consequences. They will do this by also learning about the American Revolution. Anyway, I love your ideas and you have one global participant if you decide. ðŸ˜‰"

Just a URL and maybe a password?How do you manage in a class where you have mixed parental permissions or where vulnerable children must keep their names and faces off the web? (This applied to a good 10% of the kids in my last school).I would love to be able to see a real photo stream in practice â€“ probably only that way would I appreciate its potential. Would also love to be able to read whatâ€™s on those whiteboards above ðŸ™‚Clive"
