        "text": " Subtitle: 10 ways to make school more engaging… The theme of the IBAP conference this year is ‘Citizenship, Connectivity, Creativity, Comapassion‘ (Exploring teaching and learning in the 21st century). So far I’m thoroughly enjoying it.  It’s been stimulating to listen to inspiring keynote speakers, to learn from and with other educators and to connect with new people from different places. It’s fun to check out the options with my colleague and choose which sessions to particpate in.  I’m wondering why we don’t try to replicate this model for our students. We could… 1. Start the day with an inspiring keynote… via TED perhaps. 2. Deliver new ideas in exciting, different ways. 3. Offer a series of workshops for students to choose from throughout the day. 4. Allow students to learn with and from learners at other grade levels 5. Give learners an opportunity to construct meaning in small breakout sessions. 6. Invite willing students to present their own sessions, supported by teachers as required. 7. Encourage students to tweet throughout the day about their learning experiences. 8. Create stalls where students can browse literature relevant  to their learning in between sessions. 9. Provide a healthy buffet lunch to feed the brain and body. 10.  Ask for and listen to their feedback regarding future learning. These thoughts were jotted down quickly, only half seriously, based loosely on my experience at the conference over the last few days. But with careful consideration,  it could probably be developed into a model of school that would foster student engagement and encourage learners to take control of their own learning. I know it’s never going to happen… certainly not while we have to focus on NAPLAN results and a prescribed national curriculum. We simply ‘don’t have the time’! But how about planning a one day ‘conference’ on a theme that’s relevant to everyone? Or a grade level ‘conference’ day as a provocation for a new unit of inquiry?  What do you think? Can you help me develop the idea further?"

Adults have developed the conference model as it is the way they prefer to learn so why not use those ideas in the classroom?The theme of 2011 for me is, so many ideas, so little time! It’s frustrating and I know it’s going to get worse.I’d love to hear others’ thoughts on the conference idea. I think it has real potential.KathleenPS – I’m looking forward to listening to your Elluminate session soon!"

        "text": "The school my son attends (junior high grades 7 -9 ) has planned a Student Conference Day every February on the day before the teachers go to their conference. Just like a teachers’ conference, the students have some input into the type of sessions they are interested in, they receive a “conference booklet” approximately 2 weeks before the day, and they sign up online for the sessions they want to attend. It is all very professionally run and students are excited by the different format for their school day.Although it is an interesting experience for the students, I question the learning that takes place and the follow-up that occurs afterwards. Adults attending conferences often feel rejuvenated and excited about the new ideas they have been exposed to, but then once back at work they quickly fall back into the regular routine often leaving the new ideas behind. The same is true for the students … unless we as their teachers deliberately bring those new ideas back to the forefront and engage in some critical and deliberate inquiry about the content.I would suggest we need to ask:– what is our purpose for holding a student conference day?– apart from the break from a regular school day, what do we want students to take away from the experience?– how can and should parents and the community be involved within the belief of “it takes a village”?– how will we follow up with students on what they have learned?– Are there opportunities for inquiry projects or student blogging, podcasts, and videos, based on the sessions? Could this lead to cross-grade level learning initiatives?– How will we model and share our learning experiences from conferences that we attend? Thanks for the opportunity to comment."

I agree with Hyacinth – what follows is vital.Another point to consider when answering your question – the speakers/ presenters put a huge effort and amount of time into preparing for conference day – this would be unsustainable as a pedagogy without a huge paradigm shift. But the point about learners inputting and choosing what to learn is one we should heed more often."
