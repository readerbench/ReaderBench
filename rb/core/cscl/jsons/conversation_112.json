        "text": " Dear Shai Your mom has invited me to present a session to student teachers in the Masters program where she works. She wants me to inspire them to focus on learning, beyond the content and methodology of their teaching. All I need to do is show them a video of you going about your daily business. At 20 months, you are inquisitive and fearless, and you are actively learning almost every minute of the day!   Observing your self driven experimentation and learning  might help them value and encourage these qualities in their learners… And it might encourage them to think about the process of learning… Does learning best take place through sitting and listening, waiting for instructions or permission, responding to the teacher and demonstrating compliance?  Or will the students learn more through… and, even in high school students… Thanks for being my inspiration, Love, Granny xx"

And 85 percent of a child’s intellect, personality and social skills are developed by that age.’Granny is clearly fascinated by observing her grandson learning and exploring his world. This is the wonder of PYP!!!!"

Unfortunately, too often the Fuller quote is true… I hope that those of us who are working hard to do just the opposite are making a difference. As a mother of a toddler I can appreciate there must never be a dull moment at Shai’s house 😀"
