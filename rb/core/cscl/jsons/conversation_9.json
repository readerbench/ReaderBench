        "text": " Listening in on Year 6 students reflecting on their learning with an outsider (a researcher exploring the PYP enhancements for the IB), I was impressed by the extent to which they understand the learning process and can articulate their understanding. I’ve been meaning to share the conversation parents had with the researcher too. The parents with the loudest voices can be the ones who constantly seem to question our approaches and prefer a more traditional model of school, so it was rewarding to listen to the insights of a small group of ‘selected volunteers’ (!) talking openly about their children’s learning experience in the PYP. These are some responses that highlight common themes… The loveliest comment I heard was this one: “PYP changes the way you parent.”"
