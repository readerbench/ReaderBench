For as long as I can remember, I have started the year by planning the first day for my new classes. Reflecting on all those new beginnings, I realise how much teaching and learning have changed… and how much I have changed. What needs to happen on ‘Day 1’ ? I used to think…  Now I think… (See links for elaboration) By whatedsaid | View this Toon at ToonDoo | Create your own Toon   "

I remember the first piece of advice I was given for starting the school year was, ‘Don’t smile for the first term!’  I sure am glad (and I bet my kids are too) that I didn’t take that advice.Although I have only been teaching for 10 years, I too have seen my first day preparations change.  This year I will have the same class again for the first time so I expect that what I do on the first day will change again this year.Mel"

I would add plan a fun activity to the list. For new or relatively new to the profession, I would suggest they read The Edutainer by Johnson & McElory. I skyped with Vedpal Yadav from India. He may try to contact you. He is a teacher at a Government Polytechnic school. Have a great with your students."

I think that’s a super interesting question because I don’t think we could imagined how things have morphed to the place where they have.I also agree with Rich’s idea about including one activity that blends fun and content area.  I teach middle schoolers…and while they definitely want to be known as a person…they are anxious and worried about what they’ll be learning.  If I can do a simple activity that sucks them into the excitement of my content, then they’ll want to come back the next day to learn more.  In science that’s pretty easy because you just do some kind of a quick demo that presents an unexpected outcome…and then they are left wondering why that thing happened.  I’m sure you get the idea.Thanks again for sharing and for giving me a list that I need to consider when I start planning my next year’s Day 1.marsha"

They’re an admission of weakness, an admission that a lot of what I teach isn’t very interesting and that I’m worried about losing control.  Besides, before I even get to know them, I’m anticipating trouble and telling them that at the first sign of it, I’m going to clamp down.Here’s a summary of my first day:http://blogush.edublogs.org/2008/08/30/what-is-the-purpose-of-the-first-day-of-school/I think establishing a mindset and expectations trumps procedures."

I’ve never really seen the point of advice like that, as it would go totally against my nature… and kids can smell deceit!Thanks again for providing some food for thought."

The teacher I was 29 years ago wouldn’t even recognise the teacher I am today – not only am I teaching a different subject (I’d never even used a computer when I first started teaching – there weren’t any in the schools I taught at), I’m also teaching primary – something that would have terrified me as a new teacher.  Then I focused on getting through the lessons, on crowd control and “getting through the books/course”.  Now I don’t have any books, and there’s no course as such and every year I learn at least as many new things as my students do.  I’m very comfortable to say to my students “I don’t know, let’s find out” and I’m a happier teacher and a better person because of it.  Thank you so much for this post – it has made me appreciate just how far I have come in my learning journey."
