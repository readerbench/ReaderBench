        "text": " I‚Äôm currently participating in a training course for IB educators to become officially recognised IB Workshop Leaders. Learning with and from passionate, knowledgeable and driven educators, with diverse backgrounds and experiences, is proving to be engaging and exciting. I‚Äôm enjoying the challenge of being pushed to think about learning in a different context. I notice again and again, that the issues discussed, the tips the leaders offer, the problems we grapple with and the strategies shared all apply just as much in teaching and learning at school as they do in running adult workshops. We reflect individually on the conditions that support and hinder our own learning, and then share in groups. There‚Äôs much commonality‚Ä¶ and difference, of course, and the leaders point out that all these are considerations to bear in mind when running workshops for other adults. These are some of the factors that come up in the conversation: (Notice anything?) As adult learners, we value‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre asked to examine a list of the characteristics of adult learners and consider the implications that these have for us as workshop leaders. It‚Äôs true we need to be aware that adults have accumulated a (longer) lifetime of knowledge and experiences that might affect our learning. Adults might come to the new learning with more preconceived ideas, stronger opinions and possibly a resistance to change. But as I work my way through the list, I‚Äôm struck again by the fact that learning is learning and there is not much difference between the way adults learn and the way children do. Before I‚Äôm criticised (yet again!) for my tendency to oversimplify, let me clarify that I am not comparing the natural curiosity and exploration of toddlers to adults studying for a PhD. (Or am I?) I‚Äôm sharing my beliefs about the ways learning works. As an educator who thinks deeply about learning, I have spent a great deal of time over the years considering almost all the things on this list in the context of student learning. How much will I need to adjust my practice when working with adults? These are my school‚Äôs articulated learning principles: (If you read this blog regularly, you‚Äôll have seen these beliefs referred to repeatedly!) Everyone has the potential to learn. It seems to me that if I bear these in mind, as I always need to do in learning situations, facilitating adult workshops will not be all that different from teaching in a classroom.

I must say that I really enjoyed this post about the difference in adult learners. It was very interesting to me because I myself am an adult student. Although I am a younger adult, I can definitely tell a difference in the way I approach my classes now as opposed to when I was in school many years ago. After being in the workforce for several years, I personally appreciate the opportunity to learn more now than I did when I was younger. I still technically learn the same way, but I feel I have a different outlook on it. I am really enjoying your blog and look forward to reading more. I am just getting started, but I would love for you to check out my blog as well. Courtney‚Äôs BlogThank you, Courtney Hieronymus"

Given the nature, backgrounds and expectations of all players in those environments, there is much about the learners and the learning one would expect to be the same.

Have you considered the difference between adults and children in relation to learning is action? Students/children turn learning into knowledge and facts to recall especially if the teacher doesn‚Äôt give students time or opportunity to take action, while adults just like the people in the WSL PD would more than likely turn their learning into action."

If a teacher can not write well, they should not be teaching writing. If they don‚Äôt have lots of printing experience, they should not teach printing. For the teachers who are teaching critical thinking and life long learning, it is critical they practice critical thinking and are life long learners.The reason is simple. When an unexpected question arises in a classroom some one who has practice can find just the right question in response to move learning forward. If one tries to trigger learning in a subject that has only been learned from books, the questions tend to be mechanical. Mechanical answers and more important questions dampen the love of learning."
