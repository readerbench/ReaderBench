Many of us are parents too and if we aren‚Äôt, you can rest assured that we wouldn‚Äôt be educators unless we cared deeply about children, so we know that many of the following things are important to you. Take a moment to consider which of these you most wish for‚Ä¶ Our teachers have been reading Contextual Wellbeing, by Helen Street, which is based on extensive research, and it turns out that the pressure induced by the items on this list, despite being instinctive desires of many parents, can actually undermine children‚Äôs wellbeing. Now consider the list below‚Ä¶ We asked parents who attended our informal session last week to sort all these aspirations into two groups. Once they got going, it quickly became clear which would put pressure on their children and which would support them in becoming well adjusted, valued and valuable members of society, content within themselves. We ask you to think about it too‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòWellbeing is a state of health, happiness and positive engagement that arises from membership of an equitable, inclusive and cohesive environment‚Äô (Helen Street 2016 )"
