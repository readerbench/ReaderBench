Someone who questions everything, is never content with the status quo, is impatient to see actionâ€¦ â€˜Have you seen the article aboutâ€¦?â€™ â€˜What do you think about this idea?â€™ â€˜I think there is a better way toâ€¦â€™ â€˜Are you free to talk about something?â€™ â€˜Could we change the way we do this?â€™ â€˜How do we make this happen?â€™ I receive these sorts of messages from my provoker at all hours of the day, sometimes when sheâ€™s in meetings with other people, sometimes while sheâ€™s out for a walk. She has what George Couros calls an innovatorâ€™s mindsetâ€¦ â€˜Innovation is a way of thinking . It is a way of considering concepts, processes, and potential outcomes.â€™ Thatâ€™s how my provoker functions. She looks at everything through a fresh lens and asks â€˜Is there a better way?â€™ (She sometimes upsets those less eager to question and be questioned). She never lets me rest. And I love that. Whoâ€™s your provoker?"
