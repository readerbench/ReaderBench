The biggest adjustment for me was to slow down and take the time I needed to recover . . . this I found difficult! Once I allowed myself to do this, after about 4 weeks from the date of my surgery many things became very clear to me. Many of them you mentioned in your blog entry. Thanks for sharing and I am still recovering but totally excited about the prospect of another school year.I trust you are well.Don WielingaTwitter: @Wielinga1"
