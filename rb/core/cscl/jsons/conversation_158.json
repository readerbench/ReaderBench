        "text": " Traditional pedagogy sees the teacher provide a set of instructions, make sure everyone â€˜knows what to doâ€™, explain everything and THEN students might be given some time to do a task themselves. Itâ€™s about 80% teacher led and 20% student. Inquiry-based pedagogy gets kids doing, thinking and investigating â€“ and the explicit teaching happens in response to what the teacher sees and hears. The 80:20 ratio is reversed. Good inquiry teachers know how to get more kids thinking more deeply more of the time. â€“ Kath Murdoch, How do Inquiry Teachersâ€¦ teach? Jocelyn (Year 6) shares her excitement at the way her students extracted the conceptual ideas from a series of learning engagements before collaboratively developing their own â€˜central ideasâ€™. We recall a time when we thought we had to explain all of this to our learners at the beginning of the unit! Claire (Year 5) talks about how she provoked her studentsâ€™ curiosity by asking simply â€˜Can graphs be persuasive?â€™ Instead of Claire covering the material, the kids took off on their own inquiries, discovering different kinds of graphs themselves and making connections between maths (data) literacy (persuasive writing) and their unit of inquiry into digital citizenship. Hailey (Year 4) reflects on the process of letting go of control, as her students develop the skills to take responsibility for their own learning. Sheâ€™s practising what Guy Claxton calls split screen teaching, and her kids are using the language of â€˜learnacyâ€™ to reflect on their own learning. â€˜Metacognitionâ€™, once a word teachers hardly understood themselves, let alone shared with learners, is not only practised but noticed and named by Haileyâ€™s students. Linda (eLearning Facilitator) tells us how sheâ€™s been supporting learners in discovering effective search strategies in an authentic context in year 5. As the children googled what they needed, they uncovered what kinds of sites would give them unbiased information and she was able to respond with tips at their point of need. She highlights the difference between this kind of learning and the old wayâ€¦ where she would stand and teach an isolated lesson on a particular computer skill, unrelated to any particular learning context. Lana (Maths Coordinator) shares the excitement of one of our new teachers, developing her understanding of inquiry. She took her Year 2 students out for a walk to collect data and encouraged them to observe and count whatever they like, to be represented visually later back at school. Once she would have given them all the same boring worksheet with specific items to count. This time the learners are highly engaged as they notice their surroundings, independently recording their observations and wonderings. We relate all these shared learning experiences back to Kath Murdochâ€™s latest blog post â€˜How do inquiry teachersâ€¦ teach?â€™ Â (Every teacher should read it!) Kathâ€™s post is our inspiration at todayâ€™s Learning Team Leaders meeting, one of a range of such communities of practice which exist within our schoolâ€™s wider learning community. Sharing practice and professional dialogue are part of our culture. Inspirational blog posts such as this one are often the trigger for our discussions. There is nothing quite so satisfying in a school as the passion in the voices of teachers, as they talk animatedly about teaching and learning, ask provocative questions, openly express frustrations, offer each other advice and supportâ€¦ The challenge is to create enough time, within the hectic demands of school life, for everyone to be involved in these conversations."
