        "text": " One of the ways I like to encourage learning based on my school’s learning principles is to promote the use of class blogs. In the lower primary years, the blogs are often used to communicate with parents and to share the learning that takes place at school. As we move higher up in the school though, the class blog has the potential to be so much more than that. I’ve written about class blogs several times in the past, but my thinking  has changed as I have watched the blogging experience unfold at my school. I have seen even the most motivated teachers become disappointed by the lack of student interest, poor response from parents and the absence of the anticipated authentic audience.  A great post this week by Andrea Hernandez, entitled Where is the Authentic Audience? got me (re) thinking. And another thought-provoking post by Kath Murdoch exploring what inquiry learning is NOT, as a way to understand what it IS, inspired me to consider class blogs in the same way. I think that a class blog is not (just)… (With apologies if you use your blog successfully in some or all of these ways!) Some questions to consider… 1. Do you teach students how to write meaningful comments that promote conversation? 2. Do you set aside time every day to check  for new comments and  discuss the comments that come in? 3. Do you encourage your students to respond to each other and whoever else comments? 4. Does your blogroll include other class blogs within your own school and are your students actively engaging with these? 5. Do you encourage your students to comment on class blogs at schools in your own and other parts of the world? 6. Have you and your students considered ways to involve their grandparents and retired people they know as a potential audience? 7. Do your students have ownership of the layout and theme of your class blog? 8. Do you frequently discuss the potential  audience and purpose of blog posts? 9. Do you model good writing for your students by blogging yourself? ( A collective in-school blog doesn’t require a great time commitment). 10. Do you regularly read and comment on other teachers’ blogs and discuss your learning with your students? 11. Do you encourage students to take photographs of great learning experiences and share their reflections with the world? 12. Do you have a visitors map or a flag counter and check them every day with your class to see who has visited and where they are in the world? 13. Have you considered a class Twitter account to share learning and tweet your posts to other classes? 14. Have you thought about blogging as authentic writing, rather than another separate thing you have to fit in? 15. Do your students choose where to post their writing and thinking, with the blog as just one option? 16. Have you exposed your students to great blogs (not just class ones) so that they can discover what makes a blog appealing and interesting? 17. Have you helped your students see how blogging is different from other writing? Can they drill down to the essence of something, add images and use  hyperlinks? 18. Do your students see the blog as an additional place to share and provoke thinking, and to make thinking visible? 19. Is your blog a place to continue the learning conversation from school to home and back? 20. Are you working on building a learning community which includes yourself, students, parents and other learners in your school and the world?"

I am the only teacher in my building interested in blogging, therefore I have to fit my class blog in around all of the other initiatives and expectations in my building. I don’t think my blog makes it onto the “what a blog is not” list, but many of your 20 questions fill me with anxiety as a new class blogger. I am especially interested in 13, 16, and 17, but struggle to find the time to fit those conversations in. Thanks for a great post!Laura"

You can follow my class blog at EDM310blogspot.com.    I see a lot of teachers that have a class blog, but they are not being followed by parents and the students are not using them except for when they are at school.  I know that where my kids go to school, many of the parents can not afford a computer at home.  Some of the teachers blog and others do not blog at all.  I think that class blogs are very useful, but I see that they are not for everyone.  I do feel that the more we teach the younger kids the more it will become a part of everyday life. you have to just keep trying and never give up."

It is so helpful to hear from teachers who have been doing it for awhile, and your questions really help focus on those key elements of blogging.  For me, it is very important to make it authentic and imbedded in my instruction.  I have found it to be very meaningful for my students and it definitely improves writing!  Giving my students ownership of the blog is important – it takes time with younger students.  Right now we write posts together as shared writing.  My goal this year is to have students eventually choose and write blog posts. I am still working on ways to make my blog a learning community.  But I believe it is well worth the effort."

Neither my students nor I am a native speaker of English but I am constantly thinking about the possibilities of introducing  authentic materials of English to my students. I started a class blog a few months ago and keep following some interesting teacher blogs.  I am also interested in how a blog grows and matures, so I would click on posts that were written many years ago. After reading this article, I reflected on my class blog and noticed that I had fallen into many of the pits you mentioned. As a teacher blogger, how would you view the application of blogging on TEFL?  Can the aforementioned ideas of class blog be applied to a teaching context like mine? The following is my blog of news English, http://patty102.wordpress.com/I would also like to recommend a great teacher blog done by a friend of mine, http://benology0317.wordpress.com/   Both of us just started our blogs this September. As far as I know, there are very few English teachers integrating blogging with their teaching in Taiwan.  However, by sharing my own experiences with others, I hope blogging could benefit more English teachers and learners in my country."
