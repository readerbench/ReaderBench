People aren‚Äôt always at the same stage of development, after all, and not everyone has the same PD needs. Today was an exception. All sessions were presented by teachers for teachers and it was a resounding success! The morning was divided into three one-hour sessions, where teachers were invited to ‚Äògive one, take 2‚Äô. ¬†Some teachers were asked to present on external PD workshops they had previously attended, while others volunteered to present on topics of their choice. Some preferred the comfort of presenting together with one or two peers. ¬†All teachers selected which workshops they wanted to participate in. Sessions included such things as‚Ä¶ In the afternoon, we had a whole school session, showcasing the learning from K-6 through one trans-disciplinary theme, ¬†‚ÄòHow we express ourselves‚Äô. Teachers who hadn‚Äôt facilitated workshops in the morning were responsible for these presentations. It‚Äôs so easy to focus on your own class or the year level that you teach. This was a wonderful opportunity to see how learning progresses and thinking develops ¬†from 3 year olds, up through the primary years. It was apparent that we have an amazing bunch of teachers across our 3 campus, K-6 Primary School!¬†Teachers love to learn from other teachers and appreciated the fact that they could choose their own learning. Some found¬†that preparing for their workshops ¬†made them revisit PD they‚Äôd attended and helped them consolidate what they had learned. Many valued the opportunity to step outside their comfort zone and present to their peers for the first time (although some only valued it after their sessions were over!)  Here are a few samples of teacher feedback‚Ä¶ We‚Äôll definitely be doing this again!! ¬†"

It‚Äôs wonderful to hear the words ‚Äúby teachers for teachers‚Äù, your right many dislike whole school CPD days as PD needs are different for each and every one of us. However learning from your own environment from time to time is significant, the relevancy of the environment can significantly impact upon learning. Teachers don‚Äôt have to imagine applying principles in their schools but they can immediately relate and see it physically in practice. Most other professions in the world learn within their own environment, seeks professional guidance, support and encouragement from their internal teams, so why shouldn‚Äôt we do this within the teaching environment. Teachers are in-house experts, which is evident from your post. Each school has a pool of fantastic teachers, educational staff and leaders, a natural community, but one that can be quite often forgotten in every day teaching and learning. Group sessions as you described is an effective entry method to this community, one that can be united by common ground,  an area to chat about your daily activities in an environment that is not just friendly but one that understands you, validates your concerns and ultimately has the shared expertise and relevant answers and best practice examples to support  everyday lives, impact teaching & learning positively!Blogging is such a great tool for PD, there is a particular teacher i follow who writes particularly well and clearly utilises the opportunity for PD. http://www.oliverquinlan.co.uk/blog/?page_id=293 also available on twitter @oliverquinlan. I look forward to your future posts! Thanks Again"

Ours is a three campus school, but because of time restraints , one doesn‚Äôt really get a chance to share ideas and benefit from each others‚Äô expertise. Today I learned just how generous and ready to share my wonderful colleages are! I feel energised to try out 21st Century technology because it was amazing to see first hand how blogs and skype open up a classroom to the world, and I now know where to seek help with implementing this!This afternoon the teachers shared in each others teaching and learning as a whole school. It gave me such a buzz to see the children that I taught in 3 year old kinder (who are now in Prep) expressing themselves so confidently through drama. It was a really great and inspiring day celebrating the learning journey from K-6!"

I‚Äôve been involved in whole school professional development sessions where teachers opt for a workshop to attend and from my experience, teachers appreciate the opportunity to select which one is most appropriate to them. For me, this is the way forward: make it relevant!Also, i‚Äôm a big believer in professional development being a shared responsibilty from the entire staff of a school. We should spot talent and encourage them to think about the most effective ways of sharing good practice. Essentially, your school is encouraging others to be leaders in their fields. And this will pay huge dividends.  We should also not forget the courage that it takes for colleagues to lead such sessions. I always show my appreciation for attending sessions by thanking them afterwards due to the risks that they are taking by facilitating them. I‚Äôd be interested to hear about what the people who led the sessions learnt from them.By the way, I loved how you used Skype to communicate with people around the world during your session. How about that for risk taking: love it!"

The PD is done after school for about an hour.It‚Äôs been great to see my fellow teachers present their ideas ‚Äì they have so much to give. It‚Äôs also way cheaper to do the PD and we get a wide range of ideas presented. Last year we had 10 different teachers do a PD event for a total of over 18 events. Someone usually brings snacks and drinks and it‚Äôs been really fun."

Having teachers present their ideas to each other seems like a create way to build teacher unity in the school as well as giving teachers opportunities to talk about what they have tried and become good at.  Teaching to each other really is effective professional development.  The teachers at my school meet every Tuesday mornings with a topic in mind to work on in small groups, then discuss as a whole.  It provides some benefit because we are bouncing ideas of one another, but it lacks a real connection between what we learn and what the students then learn in the classroom.   It would be great to see a PD sessions like the one you described where I can attend a session by one of my colleagues on a strategies and practices I am eager to learn more about.  I will be talking with my fellow teachers about setting up a PD ‚Äúconference‚Äù like this one at our school."
