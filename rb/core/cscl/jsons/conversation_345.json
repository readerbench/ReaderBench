        "text": " I have a new friend. His name is Kalpesh and he lives in Talere, Maharashtra, India. Heâ€™s 15 years old, in 10th grade and his favourite subject is science. He likes his teacher because he makes jokes. Kalpesh loves Ben 10 cartoons, is a karate fan and likes to play cricket. His best friendâ€™s name is Raviraj. His home language is Marathi and he speaks Hindi too. His English is limited to the classroomâ€¦ and now his interactions with me.Â  I learn these things from our interactions via Skype through the SOLE project, about which I have written before hereÂ and here. Itâ€™s amazing how much weâ€™ve already learned from each other, when you consider the limitations of our communication. Apart from the language barrier, there is no sound when we connect, although there is video, so we communicate by typing and by hand and facial gestures.Â This SOLE is inÂ the Vaibhavwadi taluka of Sindhudurg, Maharashtra, in the village of Talere, although the children also come from surrounding villages. Iâ€™m told that the SOLE itself is a room with a tin roof which makes it feel like an oven in the summer heat. During our â€˜conversationâ€™ about school, Kalpesh tells me there are 80 children in his class. He knows Iâ€™m a teacher and asks to see photos of my school, so I show him a few images of students learning in the classroom. His responses are usually brief and often single words and I know he doesnâ€™t always understand what I type, because then he simply doesnâ€™t respond. So I wonder if heâ€™ll know what I mean when I ask â€˜What did you notice?â€™ Iâ€™m filled with mixed emotionsâ€¦ shame at having shown him the colourful classroom with small groups working at laptopsâ€¦ pleasure that he has understood and responded in a whole sentenceâ€¦ gratitude for the opportunity to see what learning looks like in a different contextâ€¦ disappointment that thereâ€™s no sound and I canâ€™t hear what heâ€™s saying to the other children as they laughâ€¦ frustration at the limitations imposed on our conversation by languageâ€¦ warmth towards these eagerly responsive childrenâ€¦ delight that despite the obstacles, I have managed to make a connectionâ€¦ I would love to.

You re opening up Kalpeshâ€™s world so, although you may be somewhat uncomfortable showing him photos of your school situation which is so unlike his own, you are also giving him the opportunity that life is different elsewhere and maybe this is the knowledge that empowers people. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve voiced this very well, but I hope you get what I mean."

But the difference in the kind and extent of resources does not appear to have hindered the interaction. I feel the same way quite frequently when they ask to have the webcam pan around my house so they can look around and have been after me to bring them to Pune ðŸ™‚  . or even when I am physically present at the SOLEs, I am conscious of the fact that I do come across â€˜differentâ€™ despite my dress, the fact that I speak the same language etc.  But what comes across quite strongly is that this [awareness of difference] is part of  opening up horizons via curiosityâ€¦ Lets see where it all leadsâ€¦"

I understand what you mean about your mixed emotions. On one hand itâ€™s good to connect around the world; on the other hand, I know it is tough to be behind so many communication barriers. I suppose a connection is better than none at all. Also, I am a student at the University of South Alabama and Iâ€™m currently enrolled in Dr. Strangeâ€™s EDM310 class. I will be keeping up with your blog when I can because this is one of the most interesting and informative ones that I have come across.Thanks a ton,Kevin White"
