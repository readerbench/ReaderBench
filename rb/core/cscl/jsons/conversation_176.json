        "text": " How would you respond to a parent who is convinced that having an iPad in the classroom will make her child less smart? ‘What’s to stop him just looking up answers instead of using his brain?’ she asks. I explain that education isn’t just about ‘knowing the answers’ any more, since ‘answers’ tend to be readily accessible to all.  It’s more about learning how to ask questions and to find, interpret and critically analyse the answers. It’s less about remembering facts and more about conceptual understanding. It’s less about knowing stuff and more about knowing how to learn... Half an hour earlier, my presentation had, I thought, included wonderful examples of ways technology has enhanced learning; kids ‘using their brains‘ not just to ‘find answers’ but to apply their knowledge creatively, such as… But this parent remains unconvinced. What more can I say? Below: Some images of kids ‘not using their brains’… "

        "text": "I guess it takes time and continual parental education for a change in thinking for some.  We are often in discussion with parents about why education doesn’t look like it did when they were at school. It’s interesting because when asked, of course they want education to be progressive, it makes sense to them that innovation in education is needed, but when it comes to what it ‘looks like’ in their child’s classroom they keep going back to what they are familiar with as a model. Shame as it seems like is was a great presentation Edna, I would imagine there are other parents that came away with wonderful new insights."

Mind you, so are we, so miracles do happen 😉I find the best way is a two-pronged attack:First, they want their children to have the best chances, so I explain that knowing ‘stuff’ is no longer any differentiator.  Knowing where to find answers and what questions to ask, how to interpret information and be creative in their approach – those are the skills that may separate the haves from the have-nots in the age of the knowledge worker – even if that kid’s going to be a brain surgeon.Second, I ask them to describe a successful 25 year-old.  I bet they will talk about their kid being happy, sociable, connected, and a long way down the list will be academic prowess.  Being able to recruit other people – co-workers they may never need face-to-face – are going to be increasingly important.  Ask them to watch this new video (http://goo.gl/KH7BP3) from Ericsson to see the way employers and educators think about the world our kids are moving into…"

Our pictures of children using chromebooks often look like yours of iPads, sometimes as a stand-alone, sometimes as part of a whole heap of info, research tools and the like. Looking at our sixth formers, and they often have iPads/phones out alongside the chromebooks, files, materials and equipment, collaborating together to find answers to the curriculum challenges they are set. ‘What’ as they say ‘is not to like’?So I suspect the problem is that parents see the children at home using the same devices as toys, for gaming, for media consumption, for entertainment.  It would certainly upset me if I saw my children using my cherished Mont Blanc fountain pen as a stick for hoopla!  That’s gives me an idea for a blog by the way so ©. :o)"

They will see how students use a range of apps to demonstrate their conceptual understanding or apply their understanding in a new context or consolidate their understanding, etc. They will be able to talk to the students about their learning. Seeing learning happen in front of your eyes via an iPad is undeniable evidence of the value of adding this tool to our tool kit 🙂"

We are living a change of paradigm, and it is very difficult to analyse things from inside the forest. People who are not part of the educational process might find it hard to see the change.

I’ll ask students a question for HW that requires them to apply something they’ve learned in class and yet they still google the question I generate, copy and paste, and turn it in!I asked students “Were labor unions effective or ineffective in the late 1700s/early 1800s in meeting their goals?” Several students went to Wiki Answers or another source instead of simply referring to their text or notes to help formulate their response. This has happened on several assignments so far this year.So far, teaching in the iPad 1:1 model has inhibited original thinking and increased laziness and apathy in many students. What can be done to prevent students from Googling answers to my HW questions that go beyond facts, names, dates?"
