Year 5 students at my school are learning about Aboriginal culture. Twitter led me to @jessica_dubois,Â as a result of which classes at our schools were able to interact via Skype last week. It was an incredible learning experience for both sides! 3. Ongoing connections with PYP educators like @jessievaz in Chile, @maggiswitz in Switzerland, @sherratsam in Thailand and @garethjacobson Â in Bangladesh (among others!), to whom I can turn for advice and ideas relating to learning in the PYP. 4.Â #ElemchatÂ is a weekly Twitter chat for primary school teachers to discuss issues and share practice. Itâ€™s great to get different perspectives from all over the world and the connection with talented organisersÂ @tcashÂ in Morocco andÂ @gretÂ in Argentina is an added bonus. 5. Year 1 teachers at my school have recently started blogging and are keen to make global connections for their students. Via Twitter, Iâ€™ve found them a number of interested teachers and classes in Colombia, Switzerland, Canada, Indonesia, Chile and the US and inspired them further with the work of @grade1 to see what is possible. 6. Inquire Within, a collaborative blog about inquiry learning,Â has a range of contributors from twelveÂ countriesÂ across six continentsâ€¦ all via Twitter. (Join us!) 7. Upper Primary teachers at my school were inspired by a SkypeÂ session on literacy and class blogging withÂ @kathleen_morris and @kellyjordan82Â a few months ago and the dynamic duo has agreed to do another session next term to inspire teachers in the lower grades too. 8. @toughLoveforXÂ is a retired printer and design teacher in NY, who comments with interest on my blog and our school class blogs, giving valuable insights and asking tough questions about education that make me think (and act).Â  9. Â It was great to have @henriettaMi, who I know through blogs and Twitter, visit our school when she was recently in Melbourne to present at a conference. SheÂ graciouslyÂ agreed to present an after-school session to further inspire teachers at my school with their class blogs. 10. Endless advice, assistance, support, collaboration,Â encouragement, inspiration, motivation â€¦ and friendship. Why wouldnâ€™t you want to be part of it?Â  Let me know if you want help getting started. Edna  By whatedsaid | View this Toon at ToonDoo | Create your own Toon"

One day I decided to â€˜tweetâ€™ I wasnâ€™t sure what would happen, who would respond or how someone out there would respond. Someone did and it just went from there. 2 years go by and I meet some of my Tweeps at a Tweetup, finally meeting face to face. Awesome feeling that connection.The power of twitter is the sharing and collaborating, the feeling that youâ€™ve got a tribe out there that you can call on for support, ideas and encouragement. And as an educator thatâ€™s a pretty powerful tool to add to my personal learning network. Someone at the last conference I went to likened Twitter to â€˜being in someone elses brain. Im in about 500 so far, and learning more every day."

I did not even have a Twitter account until Dr. Strange made it required for us to make one and get involved.
