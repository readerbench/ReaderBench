        "text": " It was the first time I had led a â€˜Making the PYP Happenâ€™ workshop and it was for teachers at my own school, so I approached the planning with a strong sense of responsibility. How wouldÂ I ensure the workshop was valuable and would impact on practice? MTPYPH is a workshop for teachers new to the PYP and its name describes it. The purpose of the workshop is to support participants, not just in understanding the principles and practices of the PYP, but in actually â€˜making it happenâ€™ for themselves and their students in their own particular learning environments. The philosophy and underpinning principles of the PYP correlateÂ closely with myÂ schoolâ€™sÂ beliefs about learning.Â One of our new teachers (with a background in PYP schools) said â€˜ The difference is that you LIVE the PYP hereâ€™. Iâ€™ve thought a lot about what that means! It means weÂ go beyond fulfilling requirements and ticking boxes. ItÂ means we are not afraid to question or challenge the aspects that are lessÂ compatible with our beliefs.Â It means we constantly reflect on how best to make it meaningful in our context. So planning the recent workshop, with my colleague Joc, included thoughtfulÂ consideration ofÂ how toÂ take it â€˜beyond the bookâ€™ and make it relevant and thought provoking. We wanted to focusÂ on theÂ big ideas in order to Â helpÂ the teachers makeÂ connections between the separate elements. This unitÂ map was helpful in pulling the elementsÂ together and went far beyond the original intention (as learning experiences do when the learners take control!) The teachers changed the directions of the arrows and added their own as they realisedÂ connections and developed new understandings. This led to ideas forÂ how to improve and develop the unit map for future use. The workshop focused on Â inquiry, concept driven learning and constructivism. Teachers exploredÂ the PYP curriculum model and essential elements through the lenses of these big ideas, by inquiring, focusing on big ideas and constructing meaning themselves, both collaboratively and through individual reflection. Itâ€™s been gratifying to hear them reflect on the shifts they are already makingâ€¦ Seems like they ARE making the PYP happen."

It felt like cleaning the wordrobe from all the clothes I donâ€™t need but still was unsure I can really get rid of them.  Now I know,  I can, and nobody could tell me differently ðŸ˜ƒThank you Ed and Joc  for very inspiring, well planned and fun workshop! It is much appreciated."

The workshop was an opportunity for me to build knowledge, confidence and relationships with other educators. I really enjoyed both days â€“ Thank you Edna and Jocelyn."

Having it all in front of you and able to see everything is really valuable and clear to identify links. I think if we could have also have seen a couple of â€˜model unitsâ€™ and gone through why they were successful would also have been good."
