Do you recognise their rights and their capabilities?Â Do you trust them to learn? 2. What do you believe about learning?Knowing what and how to teach is not enough. Have you, individually and as a school,Â thought deeply about how you believe learning takes place? Have you carefully examined the extent to which your practice aligns with your beliefs? 3. Who do you believe should hold the power?Is your token nod to agencyÂ allowingÂ the learners a choice whenÂ youÂ decide itâ€™s the time? How much of what yourÂ students say and do has to be channeledÂ through the teacher? Do you make most of the decisions? Or do you believeÂ the learners can really lead the learning?Â IsÂ initiative valued over compliance? 4. Do you see every learner as an individual?Are you tempted toÂ refer to the class as â€˜theyâ€˜ or do you always consider each individualâ€™sÂ personal story? Are you aware of what influences each studentâ€™sÂ  learning? Are your beliefs evident in your language, your expectations, the routines in your room and in the relationships you build? 5. Do your learners believe in themselves?Do you group your learners on perceived ability or do they have opportunities to learn with and from others with varying strengths, challenges and interests? Is a growth mindset fostered? Are learners motivated by learning itself, rather than extrinsic rewards that encourage winners and losers in the game of school? 6. Who do you believe should do the heavy lifting?Do you explain everything in detail, sometimes several times in different ways? Or do the learners have a go at experimenting and tackling problems first and you step in at point of need? Are you able to release control so that the heavy lifting is done by the learners? 7. Who owns the curriculum?Do you haveÂ secret teacher business? Do you always decide what to cover and how to teach it? Or do you believe that students can be empowered to exploreÂ curriculum requirements via their own inquiries, in their own ways? 8. How important isÂ measurement of achievement?Do you teach to the test?Â Do you believe everything has to be formally assessed and what canâ€™t be measured is less valuable? Or is the process of learning perceived as more significant than the outcome? Is process valued over product? 9. What is the language of your classroom?Do you talk about workÂ and tasks or does everyone speak the language of learning? IsÂ howÂ we learnÂ as much a part of the conversation as what we learn?Â Are students aware of who they are as learners? Are learning dispositions noticed and named? Do you and your students believe that reflection and metacognition are integral parts of learning? 10. Is there a safe space for risk-taking and failure?Does the learning culture encourageÂ students to take risks and make mistakes? DoÂ learners seek and grapple with challenging problems and unanswerable questions? Do you (and they) believe that failure is an opportunity to learn and grow? If youâ€™ve thought about your â€˜whyâ€™, the â€˜howâ€™ is much easier to achieve.Â  Are you asking the right question? * Influenced by the Modern Learners podcast The Answer to How is Yes.Â Now reading the bookÂ by Peter Block. (With apologies. This has been posted before under a different heading. Found the post in drafts and accidentally posted it again, deleted the previous one, now itâ€™s back with the right title. For my new friends at NES. )"

Would have loved to meet you especially since you were so close! ðŸ™‚Your post poses some very important and thought-provoking questions. I really liked them and will share them with my staff to reflect on as we try to understand, negotiate and implement Agency with seriousness, not just because it is the new buzz word, but because we need to review how much of agency have we promoted and how much more can we go further.Thanks again!"

Andâ€¦ the reality of empowering staff to focus on self empowerment for themselves and students in a manner that encourages staff to grow is of paramount importance. Encouraging and empowering staff the correct way will say whether students are served, or not."
