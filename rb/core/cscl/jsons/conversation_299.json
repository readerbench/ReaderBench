        "text": " What do our students know about the countries around us?¬† Not that much, apparently. Our Year 6 classes have kicked off their new unit of inquiry by thinking about what it means to be a good¬†neighbour¬†and then discussing which of the requirements apply to being good global citizens too. They know we need to work towards understanding our geographical neighbours, engaging with and learning from them, but it seems that many aren‚Äôt quite sure who our neighbours are! By the end of the unit they will know a great deal more. They will inquire into Australia‚Äôs interconnectedness with countries in the Asia Pacific, explore the region through Google Maps and a range of other resources and, best of all, they will interact with real people to find out about the countries in which they live. ‚ÄúLearning ¬†from someone is much more real than learning about them.‚Äù ¬†(Year 6 student) In my very first post on this blog, I stated that my goal was to flatten the walls, take the learning beyond the classroom out into the world, and bring the world inside. Not long after that, the first time Year 6 explored this topic, I persuaded the teachers to have the kids interview a friend in India via Skype. It was an experience that opened new doors and highlighted what was possible. A year later, for the same unit of inquiry, student‚Äôs created a Voicethread with their questions and were able to pursue their personal inquiries via Skype too. They interacted with people in Japan, India, Singapore, Thailand, Bali and Sri Lanka. This year, we would like to find even more primary sources in every country that our learners choose to investigate. Rather than a formal class structure, it would be great to see them in small groups talking via Skype to as many people as possible. We‚Äôd love to have them engaging with students in other countries and continuing to connect with them after the initial interviews. ¬†It would be great to see them work collaboratively on Google Maps to which they add photos, information, questions and new learning.¬†Hopefully they will use their class blogs to reflect on what they learn and to record their wonderings, so that people ‚Äòout there‚Äô can respond. Do you want to help us learn? Do you live in the Asia Pacific Region?¬†You don‚Äôt need to be an expert. We‚Äôd be happy to send you some questions in advance, if that helps. We don‚Äôt mind using Skype, Voicethread, email or any other collaborative tool we know or have yet to learn (if it‚Äôs not blocked in our school‚Ä¶). We‚Äôd love you to include some students, preferably Year 6 or older, as we sometimes ask tough questions, but we‚Äôre just as happy to talk to adults.¬†We‚Äôre willing to tell you a bit about Australia, in return. If you‚Äôd like to join our learning community and can spare us a little time in the coming weeks, please let us know.  Update: My PLN has delivered willing people or classes in India, China, Singapore, Korea, Japan, Phillipines, NZ and Indonesia! Still looking for Thailand, PNG, East Timor, Malaysia, Burma and Laos‚Ä¶ Final update:¬†We got Malysia, Laos, Thailand.. and a few came too late, as our school year is just about over, but we‚Äôll save them for future collaborations. Thank you!"

I‚Äôm thinking that once the assignment is done that I‚Äôll put the reviews up on a blog or wiki so that others can access it & contribute to it.
