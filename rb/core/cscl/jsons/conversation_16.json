        "text": " As we begin the self study for our IB PYP evaluation, itâ€™s worth considering how to make it feel less like an inspection (compliance, judgement) and more like an invitation to reflect and an opportunity for growth. What if we view the process as an appreciative inquiry?Â  Define: How best might we LIVE the PYP?Â  Rather than proving how we comply with the standards, letâ€™s continue to explore how best to bring them to life. Discover: What isâ€¦? Reflect on our practice, identify our strengths and celebrate our successes. Dream: What if..? Fearlessly and creatively ask â€˜what if?â€˜ and imagine new possibilities. Design: How might weâ€¦? Identify the best possibilities for innovation, encourage our people to take ownership and bring their ideas to life. Deliver: How will weâ€¦? Take action. Make things happen ðŸ™‚ Â  (Thanks @fionannbir and @megangraff)"
