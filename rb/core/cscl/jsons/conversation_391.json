        "text": " Year 6 students are learning about our geographical neighbours. They have considered carefully what kinds of things they need to know in order to best gain an understanding of the countries around us, so as to help them develop a global perspective. Yesterday they interacted on Skype with our friends in India. They asked about social inequities like gender discrimination and were fascinated by the responses of Raj, Kuppu and their students at Zoho University. Hereâ€™s a sampleâ€¦  Watch this spaceâ€¦ Tomorrow small groups will Skype with Thailand, Singapore and Sri Lanka. We have a Voicethread with studentsâ€™ questions too, so if you are somewhere in the Asia Pacific and would like to join the inquiry, let us know. We have collaborators in Japan, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Vietnam, New Zealand and theÂ Philippines, so far! Remember when we could only learn from textbooks? "

When I saw this video yesterday morning, it brought back happy memories about a French teacher who, in the sixties, was telling her teenaged French-Canadian students to connect with the world by finding pen-pals. I found a few but with a Japanese boy in Tokyo, it just clicked. I even wrote the story on my blog: http://edenhaiku.posterous.com/lost-in-translationThanks for the inspiration!"
