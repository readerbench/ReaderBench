They should be finding their own path and figuring out the ways that they learn best.”    ~ Georgia, Year 6. The Year 6 PYP exhibition is a prime example of the kind of learning that is unleashed when students own their learning. The confidence and understanding with which Georgia and the other learners shared this learning experience are evidence of the power of student ownership… Looking forward to increasing opportunities for student ownership in 2016!"
