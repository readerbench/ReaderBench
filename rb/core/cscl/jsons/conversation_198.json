So, I’m wondering… Is writing something that happens in period 3 on Tuesdays?  or Are your learners constantly picking up a pen (iPad) to write their reflections, thoughts and ideas? and Is writing a task that you set? or Do your students have time to write (something!) every single day?  and Do you write? or  Do you wonder if  your writing is ‘good enough’? — Just write…  Image: Jenna Avery"

I’m trying to jump back on the train now. I’d like to have my students do more reflective writing next year. Maybe I can use some of that time to do more writing myself?"

As much as our curriculum stresses writing, I found it hard to fit informal writing time in for students during the last months of the year, and my own writing was not happening in those same months, either. End of the school year meant we had lots of interruptions for special events. I can handle it if the lack of time was a temporary phase, but it’s on my list of things to think about in preparing for next year — how I will keep my writing going during the school year, and how to make time in my students’ schedule to reach all the activities I’d like them to do. Thanks for the great post!"
