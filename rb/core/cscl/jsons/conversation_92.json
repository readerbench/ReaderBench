        "text": " Inspired by this post to children, by Colleen Wilson. In case you think it goes unnoticed‚Ä¶ To the teacher who changed one small thing in your classroom thereby making a difference to the learning, I see you. To the teacher who struggled to communicate difficult news to parents and managed to make them feel supported, I see you. To the teacher who found technology challenging but overcame fear and got the children blogging, I see you. To the teacher who wrestled with the option of an interesting job offer and made the decision to stay and make a difference, I see you. To the teacher who had to deal with complaints, yet has risen to the challenge and decided to become the best educator possible, I see you. To the teacher who thought she was ordinary and had to be pushed to realise her incredible potential, I see you. To the teacher who was afraid to let go, but is gradually beginning to hand over control to the learners, I see you. To the unassuming teacher, reluctant to put herself out there and share the amazing learning taking place in her classroom, I see you. To the teacher who finds difficult situations intimidating and often blames herself, but works tirelessly to make things better for other human beings, I see you. To the teacher who worried about managing what everyone else was doing and instead had the courage to try something different, I see you. To the teacher who shifted from ‚Äòdoing school‚Äô to observing carefully in order to be ready when the special moment happened, I see you. To the teacher who measured herself against others and didn‚Äôt see herself as a leader but is ready to step up now, I see you. To the teacher fearful of change, who clung to old ways of doing things and finally leaped out of her comfort zone, I see you. To the teacher who is filled with self doubt, always thinking he could have done better, not realising that‚Äôs how all good teachers feel, I see you. Thank you. (Back in 2016.)"
