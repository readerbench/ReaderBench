Â At 6am Melbourne time, the session kicked off on Justin.tv. Â Educators in different places presented examples of how they use technology in their classrooms. Â At the same time, conversation and discussion was happening in twitter about what we were seeing. Â What an incredible network of people sharing, encouraging and learning from one another! You can find the link to the presentations on the edtechroundup wiki. Apart from the actual content of the presentations, here are some of the things I got out of it: "

All the presentations were fantastic and best of all you can still view them if you didnâ€™t manage to drop into the event. Long may such events continue and inspire others to try the ideas out in their own classrooms."

I am still very unsure of how to approach teachers declaring the PLN as the way forward. They are all so busy and one hates to encroach on precious time. But building a PLN â€“ blogs, twitter, bookmarks, photos, networks of choice â€“ is so rewarding. It simply makes my job so much better.Thank you for attending TMETRU09."
