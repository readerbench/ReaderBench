        "text": " Teachers never have enough time. We have curriculum to cover, skills to teach, reports to write and meetings to attend. The demands are endless, both in and outside the classroom. 10 ways to save time, both in and out of the classroom. I‚Äôm sure you there are hundreds more so please share yours. 1. Don‚Äôt talk about how little time you have. Use the time to do some of the things you don‚Äôt have time for. 2. Reduce meeting time. Only meet if you have to. Start on time or have something to do while you wait. Keep it brief. Stay on topic. Don‚Äôt get sidetracked. 3. Set the timer. When you feel overwhelmed by everything you need to do, set the timer for 15 minutes and start. You‚Äôll be amazed how much you can get done. Do this once a day and see what you can achieve. Try it with your students too. 4. Talk less in the classroom. Establish routines. Use signals. Trust your students, everything doesn‚Äôt have to be controlled by you. Scaffold independent learning so that students can get on with it. 5. Collaborate on a Google doc. You don‚Äôt need to email documents back and forth. You don‚Äôt need to meet with the people. You don‚Äôt even need to be in the same place. ¬†Work together on the one doc.¬†Use different colours to show who said what. Use it with students too. 6. Use Twitter. If you need a resource, a video, an article, a song or a tool‚Ä¶ someone else has found it already. Ask for help on twitter. Help others in the same way. There‚Äôs on tap support 24 hours a day. 7. Have small group discussions. Give every student an opportunity to speak without having a whole class discussion. Move between the groups. Have groups share with the class only what was most interesting or most¬†contentious. 8.¬†Set up a class blog. It‚Äôs an easy way to learn with your students. They can respond to questions, comment on each other‚Äôs presentations and have discussions, without taking up class time. 9. Manage your emails. Set up class and parent distribution groups. Organise folders in your inbox so that you can easily file things you might need later. Act quickly on emails and delete when done. 10. Prioritise. Acknowledge that you are human and can‚Äôt always do everything. Decide what is urgent and what can wait. Accept that you aren‚Äôt ready for some things and will get to them when you are. And if you have any spare time, watch some of these! http://www.teachers.tv/series/time-savers What are your tips?  By whatedsaid | View this Toon at ToonDoo | Create your own Toon"

Only volunteer for those things that you can‚Äôt resist.  You are never going to please everyone (they‚Äôll get over it). You have a job to do."

We can make nice, structured and intensive lessons almost ‚Äúout of the blue‚Äù ‚Äì with a list of points to present and recycle at hand only. Looking for worksheets, printing them out, sorting them out, giving them out , explaining what to do with them ‚Äì it eats up loads your classroom and personal time.‚Äì have your students do some of your work (this is similar to ZGPorter‚Äôs tip, but I don‚Äôt think only advanced SS can do it): grade each other‚Äôs papers, create revision exercises for classmates, bring great photos, you name it. This will no way be perfect ‚Äì but definitely  useful. I found that students memorize much more when they make their own exercises, for example. Learner autonomy rules. üôÇ"

A couple of my own are:  make a to do list-breaking tasks down into small manageable tasks,  then star the priority items.Use your website to record daily lessons.  Insist students check the site before checking with you what they‚Äôve missed /what they‚Äôre missing.  I use the projector, put the instructions or notes up, then I cut and paste to the site.  It takes very little time each day (seconds really) and is very useful for students and parents.  When students need to catch up in my high school classroom they can be self-directed this way."

I agree with you 100 % that teachers never have enough time.   All of  the ways that you have listed for teachers to manage their time are excellent.   I especially like  number 10.  Teachers need to learn how to consider what is urgent and what is not.   I know that I need to do better at managing my time.  I am going to take all these ways that you have listed into consideration.  Thank you for the very helpful advice!"
