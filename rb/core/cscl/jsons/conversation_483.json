I appreciate my wonderful family and friends, the fact that there will always be books to read, theÂ opportunitiesÂ I have, the work I do. I love being a teacher and a learner, Â meeting new educational challenges, thinking about and debating educational ideas. My son Adrian says he hopes when heâ€™s my age (50+) he still enjoys going to work every day the way I do ðŸ™‚ That must be why, on the first day of the summer break, sitting down to check emails and book holiday flights, I found myself sucked into a discussion with educators from around the world on Twitter in #edchat, explained by Shelly Terrel here. The topic was â€˜How should formative and summative assessment be used in the classroom?â€™  The discussion was engaging, the pace was fast, the ideas thought-provoking, the debate stimulatingâ€¦ OK, Iâ€™m going back to being on holiday right now! Â But looking forward to more of theseÂ conversationsÂ next yearâ€¦"
