        "text": " Our Year 6 students are currently finding and exploring what they are passionate about as they head towards the culmination of their primary school learning in PYP exhibition. The central idea for the exhibition is ‘Exploration of interests and passions inspires learning and action.’ Within this broad conceptual understanding, students are following their own areas of interest and deciding on their individual and collaborative inquiries.  On Tuesday 13 September, we will have a full day student conference with guest and student speakers as well as workshops led by guests and students. Our students will be involved in the planning, organisation and facilitation of this conference – a manifestation of this year’s focus on student ownership and our belief in our learners.  We are looking for young people (up to 30 ish – not too far removed from our students!)  in Melbourne, Australia, who would be willing to participate in our Year 6 conference and inspire our learners by sharing their own passions.  Possible ways to be involved might include: Giving a 5 minute inspirational talk. Running an interactive workshop about exploration of passion Running an interactive workshop in your area of passion Partnering with students to lead a workshop Facilitating a reflection session of some kind One off or ongoing mentoring of/supporting students with their inquiries in Term 4. Content might include such things as: What sparked your interest or curiosity How your passion developed Your journey in exploring  your passion How your journey has helped learn about who you are Action or experiences related to your passion Evolution of your passion How your passion may have changed your life If you are interested in being involved in a dynamic student led event and supporting our learners in developing their passions,  please fill in this form by 19 August.
