        "text": "  Apparently this random comment (my response to a tweet in last week‚Äôs #edchat) was well received! This got me thinking (again) about the principles of effective professional learning for educators. In no particular order, the following points are based on my own experience. Effective professional learning needs to be‚Ä¶ 1. Conceptual  Effective learning for teachers is not always about things you can try tomorrow, but rather big ideas that shift your understanding of teaching and learning. 2. Self directed Teachers need opportunities to set their own goals, choose their own learning¬†and¬†follow their own interests. (Sometimes the most effective medium to achieve that is social media.) 3. Inquiry driven The most effective learning isn‚Äôt usually ‚Äòdelivered and received‚Äô. Teachers need to question, experiment, apply, find and solve problems, engage in action reasearch. 4. Collaborative Learn with and from others. build a personal learning network. Create communities of practice in your own school, your neighbourhood, the world‚Ä¶ 5. Creative Think beyond one-size-fits-all PD delivered by ‚Äòexperts‚Äô on special days set aside for the purpose. Create your own learning opportunities. Visit other classes. Start voluntary groups. Participate in Teachmeets. Engage via Twitter and blogs.¬†Find your own people! 6. Personalised How often are teachers compelled to attend one-size-fits-no-one sessions, not relevant to their current programs, practice, interests or experience? Even on school wide ‚ÄòPD days‚Äò, teachers can have a choice. 7. Reflective Too often, teachers are expected to shift rapidly from one ‚Äòtopic‚Äô to the next (@lisaburman called it ‚ÄòHit and run‚Äô). Effective learning includes sufficient time for reflection, application‚Ä¶ and further reflection. 8. Active Learning is often less effective when the expectation is for learners to listen passively. There need to be active participation and engagement, opportunities to interact, reflect and construct meaning. 9. Enjoyable (I crowd sourced this one). Teachers like their professional learning to include humour and a sense of fun. It doesn‚Äôt need to be a boring chore! 10. Challenging Professional learning (like any learning) can be messy. There should be tensions to work through and big ideas to connect. It goes beyond solutions and formulae and things to try out tomorrow‚Ä¶ which takes us back to where we started! Of course, all of this applies to any learners, not just teachers. Try replacing the word ‚Äòteachers‚Äô throughout the above post with ‚Äòstudents‚Äô, or simply ‚Äòlearners‚Äô‚Ä¶ which takes me back to a post I wrote a while ago about adult vs child learners. What are your thoughts on that? What‚Äôs been your best professional learning experience? Did it fit the above criteria? What have a I missed?"

An important challenge, I think, is balancing the requirements of professional development that is both self-directed and collaborative, particularly when the importance of sustained team-based collaboration within the school is taken into consideration. A fundamental responsibility of leadership is creating school cultures that enable continuous improvements in teaching, learning, and relationships within the school community. A core process of such cultures is strong and effective teacher teamwork driven by common, compelling, and stretching learning goals for themselves and for the students they collectively serve."

Only one aspect is also mentioned: permanence and sustainability. This implies that effective professionalisation must take some time, allowing people to get used to new ways of thinking and working. Also, the chosen interventions must be building blocks for new development, instead of ‚Äòsomething totally different‚Äô. And it‚Äôs very important that the chosen professionalisation really adds on to the school development, so that the chance of bringing new learning into practice rises.Let‚Äôs work hard to make this all happen.

I am a VIT CRT Network Coordinator and part of what I do is provide PD opportunities for CRTs (temp teachers, substitute teachers, etc) through the DEECD‚Äôs CRT Professional Learning Support Initiative (as well as a presenter of professional development myself!).  You have just described, down to a T, exactly what makes PD engaging and effective.Nothing is worse than going to a PD where 90% of the people have been forced to come, the information on offer is largely irrelevant to them, delivered straight from slideshows and doesn‚Äôt give the participants a chance to cooperate with the others to refine their understanding.  That‚Äôs when you see the smartphones come out and people playing games on facebook.The principles described here are the ones that see people leaving the workshop still excitedly discussing the information delivered or teachers coming into collegial meetings full of enthusiasm saying ‚Äúlook at what I found online!‚Äù, ‚Äúthis book is awesome‚Äù or ‚ÄúI went to see this guy and he was amzaing!‚Äù.Ed is also 100% right on how far this goes!  These are the exact same principles I teach my students with.  Be engaing by providing active learning, in a relevant way, that encourages students to explore the topics and achieve ownership over their own learning.Great post Ed!"

After the past two days working with Kath Murdoch I am fizzing and this has not come through discovering I am doing everything right or that the path will be easy, but through being challenged, inspired and seeing the difference that good Inquiry based learning has.Every moment of the learning was enjoyable, I made connections  and the team that I am working with is so collaborative that you could not have left the sessions without being inspired.Many thanks Edna for summarising this for me in on posting.Luke"

As professional teachers we are expected to differentiate for the students in our class, yet at my school the same courtesy is not extended to the staff. Having to ‚Äòdo‚Äô concept driven curriculum 3 times in 8 years, or ‚Äòtransdisciplinary learning‚Äô twice inside 2 years is unnecessary and quite disrespectful.One of the best PDs I have done was the first time I did Transdisciplinary learning at a PYP conference, ad the workshop leaders genuinely catered for differences in learning pace and style. I felt like it was a genuine learning journey with genuine exploration of what it means to have a transdisciplinary curriculum."

I think it is important as life-long learners to remember that we are gaining just as much knowledge from the teachings as the facilitator is from our feedback and perspective. This principal is often lost as we know how important it is to share our knowledge once we gain it, and that each person brings a different additive lens. How do you think we can promote this type of learning within a professional environment?"

I‚Äôm supposedly the mentor, but I‚Äôm learning so much from my incredibly creative young educator partner.Two ways we bring in that sharing element you refer to- We have a collaborative teacher blog which we encourage every teacher to contribute to. And we have Professional learning days comprised of a choice workshops facilitated by teachers for teachers."
