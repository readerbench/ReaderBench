Â I had no idea that what I expressed would resonate with so many educators. Â I had no idea that I had reached or could reach so many people. Â I was thrilled by the fact that some of the educators I most admire tweeted about the post. It made me even more grateful to the friend who encouraged me to blog in the first place. Â It triggered recollections of my early posts, when I tentatively stepped into the world of blogging, with first one reader, then 3, then 5. Â Of trying to find my voice, before I realised I didnâ€™t need to do that and could simply write whatever I was thinking in the same way as I would say it! But above all, it made me see the power of blogging and tweeting and the resulting conversation with educators around the world. Â It made me appreciate the value of a dynamic, growing, inspiring and supportive online PLN. Â It made me realise that I am part of a huge community of learners, who wrestle with the same issues as I do and strive towards the same goals. "
