        "text": " Day 1 of the new school year had a hundred and twenty teachers gathered in one place to think about student ownership! What could be better?  In cross campus, mixed role groups, teachers took turns to talk about something they had learned during the holidays and how they had learned it. Conversations were varied and animated, as experiences and reflections were shared between people who don’t usually work (or play) together. *Imagine doing this as a whole year level or cross grade exercise… Our 2016 focus was introduced: Increase opportunities for ownership of learning. Teachers were asked to ponder the question – ‘What does student ownership of learning look like’? *Imagine doing this in your classroom…       How can we set a tone from Day 1 to give the message that we value student ownership? *Imagine asking your students this question… Having considered the ‘what’, the teachers now explored the ‘how’, using Ron Ritchhart’s 8 cultural forces as a scaffold: And finally, it was back to where we started: Looking forward to an exciting year of increased ownership of learning for teachers and students alike. ** Join us to unleash the learning in March at Unleashing Learning!  "

We didn’t have enough time to get to Ron Rithcard’s 8 Cultural Forces, but we will review that next week. If you are interested in seeing what my teachers came up with when sharing their thoughts about student ownership of learning, let me know and I’ll email the images through!"
