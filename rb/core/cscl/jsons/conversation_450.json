        "text": "  My 89 year old mother declared that she used to have a typewriter too, but she didn’t sit and look at it for hours on end! A colleague remarked this week that she doesn’t like sitting at the computer more than necessary, the way I do. A co-teacher said we shouldn’t be encouraging kids to sit at the computer, they should be out playing. See the common theme? Sitting at the computer is a passive activity.  None of them is even beginning to envisage what’s going on here… In the past few days, these are just a few of the things that I did, while ‘sitting at the computer’ … That’s just a taste… I’m sure there’s a great deal more I could add. But I don’t want to sit here at my computer for too long! Going for a walk around the park 🙂 "

        "text": "I am new to blogging, and this is my first reply to a blog. I usually spend my time accumulating the websites that I think are important and save them using pagekeeper.teachingmatters.org (user name LODuncan if you would like to check them out). Don’t get me wrong, I have tried following a few bloggers, but I never thought they were worthy of my time. However, I feel like what Edna has to say is good stuff. So, sitting on the computer and writing her thoughts has touched my life and inspired me to do great things like volunteer in India; therefore, I think she is achieving a lot. I love the recommended links given in this blog – I feel like I can make a change and connect with so many more people in so many different places.Getting to the meat of the issue, I can understand both sides of the debate. I think that students need to understand how they can educationally use the computer, but also run around and play outside. The computer, like everything, is about how it is used. I think the PYP learner profile word “Balanced” pretty much sums this one up. On this issue, I believe that you can have your cake and eat it too.If it wasn’t for computers and the information age that we live in, I wouldn’t be where I am, which is teaching at an awesome PYP international school in China. I am grateful for all the opportunities that the internet has to offer and I wouldn’t trade that for the world.Keep changing the world, one life at a time."
