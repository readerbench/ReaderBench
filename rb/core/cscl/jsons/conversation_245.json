        "text": " There are 44,500 people under 25 homeless every night in Australia. A few years ago, Bianca was one of them. Now she is working in her dream job, helping homeless youth. *** Mike is a basketball coach who works with disabled and disadvantaged kids in the Helping Hoops Program, which helps build confidence, teaches respect and trust, promotes social inclusion and develops teamwork skills. *** A huge amount of fresh food goes to waste every day and yet many people cannot afford enough food to eat ‚Äì especially healthy fresh food. Sarah works for SecondBite, who redistribute fresh food to ensure that people who are homeless or living in poverty get fresh food every day. *** In many places, girls don‚Äôt go to school, missing out on important opportunities to escape poverty. But girls are the solution to problems too. Through her work at CARE Australia, Lyrian works to help women and girls lift themselves, and their families, out of poverty. *** These and a dozen other speakers will present interactive sessions to ninety Year 6 students this week at our Equity Conference. This is the second year, we have arranged this very different way for our students to learn and it‚Äôs exciting to plan better learning opportunities each time. The idea developed last year from an idle thought¬†first¬†into a plan¬†and then into a powerful learning experience. The conference is the start of our Year 6 PYP Exhibition unit. The central idea: ‚ÄòDeveloping awareness and understanding of inequity empowers us to act‚Äô. Students will spend the next two months inquiring into this conceptual idea. It will provide the context within which they will find something they care deeply about to explore, culminating in the exhibition, where they will share their learning with parents and guests. The aims of the conference: In between sessions, students will gather in small groups to process and reflect on what they have heard and experienced. They will be encouraged to ask themselves: What does it make me feel? What does it make me wonder? What does it make me wish? What do I believe about this?¬† They will share their thinking with their groups and consider each of the issues in terms of the concentric circles model ‚Ä¶ Does this relate to the world? The local community? My family? How might it connect to me? At the end of the day, there will be an opportunity for students to express their feelings in any way they like. Stations will include a graffiti wall, art materials, tools for oral, written or video reflection‚Ä¶ and learners will be free to choose one or more media through which to express themselves. The day will embody all our learning principles and promote all the attributes of the IB learner profile. And it‚Äôs only the beginning of the learning‚Ä¶"

And so interesting to look back through your links and see the progression of central ideas and how they‚Äôve grown stronger over the last two years but still include the element of action within them. What a great group of presenters for this years conference and a fantastic provocation for the exhibition. I can‚Äôt wait to hear how it goes!"
