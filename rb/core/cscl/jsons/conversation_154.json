It’s very different from traditional approaches to education, but not so far removed from the student centred, inquiry driven learning that takes place at my school. My colleague Jocelyn, with the task of teaching her spelling group Latin and Greek derivations, decides to let go even more than usual and use the SOLE approach. She begins with Sugata’s ‘Child Driven Education’ TED talk as an introduction to provoke their thinking. All she does is show the video and ask her eleven/twelve-year-old learners to make observations and connections… In the next lesson, Joc introduces the ‘big question’ – How have other languages influenced English words?  She explains that in self organised learning environments, learners are free to choose their own groups and to move freely between groups. They will need to present their learning to others in an engaging way at the end. And then… she lets the learning happen! Marty forms a group of six and suggests they go through each step of the information process -define, locate, select, organise, present. By the end of the lesson, they have broken the big questions down into three inquiry questions and begun to explore. They will consider many ways to present but only choose later, so that they will be able to see the mode of presentation that suits best. Raf’s group realises they need some background knowledge as they only know a little about Greek and Latin roots. They immediately start researching and are very excited to find out that the English language has developed over time from so many different sources. They are intrigued to discover the extent to which wars have influenced the language. Each of the groups decides how they want to approach the learning and every group is different. Every one of our learning principles underpins this inquiry – The learners are highly engaged and motivated. The teacher sits back and observes the learning unfold… "

It ought to be utilized as a mechanism for organizing (and evaluating) Teacher-centered training experiences AND student-centered learning.  I think that your post is relevant to the latter half of the taxonomy.
