Teachers are responsible for the learning. 4. ¬†Students are obliged to respect teachers. 5. ¬†Learning can be measured by a letter or a number. 6. ¬†Teachers should plan activities and then assessments. 7. Learners need to sit quietly and listen. 8. Technology integration is optional. 9. ¬†Worksheets support learning. 10. ¬†Homework is an essential part of learning. In my opinion, all of the above are outdated ideas. I won‚Äôt elaborate at the moment, as I‚Äôd rather have your input‚Ä¶ Which ones do you agree with? Disagree? Challenge?

I have posted some similar ideas at thelearningcoach.blogspot.com I would like your reaction, as well.I think some of your claims beg a concessive clause following, such as:‚Ä¶2. Teachers have to be in control of the class. While this is not true, teachers are responsible for the safety and dignity of those who are in their class. It is not wrong for teachers to advocate certain ways of thinking in class, but their influence must be persuasive rather than intimidating.‚Ä¶ or some other such modification, as in:‚Ä¶4. students are obliged to respect teachers, just as teachers are obliged to respect students. Respect shown warrants respect given."

Teachers have to be in control of the class.Teachers don‚Äôt need to control all that happens in a class. If pupils make meaningful choices their control over their learning is greater leading to greater interaction and satisfaction. Teachers do need to promote a safe place to learn which involves negotiating a class contract.3. Teachers are responsible for the learning.Ultimately everyone is responsible for their own learning. However society often believes that teachers are responsible for pupils learning. I am interested in what you have to say on this.4.  Students are obliged to respect teachers.Respect is always earnt.5.  Learning can be measured by a letter or a number.Learning happens in so many areas of a humans makeup, spiritual, emotional, character development. These cannot be measured in letters or numbers. Alongside my pupils we decide criteria that describes success in an aspect of learning to see if more learning opportunities need to happen. Tests can be measured in letters or number, sometimes tests can measure progress in a narrowly defined area of learning. An interesting list and I haven‚Äôt even got on to the later points. Thanks for making me think and challenge my ideas."

I do not think current educational theory and practice has nothing new to offer, I think it has a lot and has been responsible for some fantastic improvements.  But‚Ä¶1. Teachers knows all the answers. Agreed, but a good teacher should strive to know the answers, they should never stop learning in order to be able to pass on their knowledge and show sts where and why they should also acquire knowledge.2. Teachers have to be in control of the class.  Depends on your definition of control, negotiated learning is v. important (one of the improvements I referred to) but fin de jour, the teacher has a responsibility to exercise their responsibility.3. Teachers are responsible for the learning.  Absolutely they are responsible for the learning, that is practically their sole responsibility ‚Äì they must create an atmosphere of trust and motivation, provide direction and knowledge and help sts to transfer input to intake ‚Äì to do otherwise abrogates responsibility.  A teacher I admired very much said that if a student succeeds then it is because the student has worked hard, if a student fails it is because the teacher has let them down.  4.  Students are obliged to respect teachers.  No argument there but their default position should be one of expectant respect which can then be either reinforced by a good teacher or destroyed by a bad one ‚Äì no-one is obliged to respect anyone but to often this argument is used to justify automatic disrespect which is equally corrosive.5.  Learning can be measured by a letter or a number. Absolutely one-hundred percent agree with you here.  Too much time is dedicated to testing and thus teaching for testing.6.  Teachers should plan activities and then assessments. If you mean and nothing else then I agree with you here too.7. Learners need to sit quietly and listen.  Sometimes they do, it is part of learning, learning not just to pay attention to a teacher/lecturer etc. but also to respect your peers who may be interested or want to listen.  I agree that silent sts all the time or even most of the time is weird but sometimes that space to listen to someone more knowledgeable than you is important and a part of mutual respect.8. Technology integration is optional.  Am torn on this one, I use technology and I like it as do my sts. But as there is so little research to support or attack its use I guess the jury is out.  Also I went to school in the 80s and early 90s when technology was pretty limited and we learnt just fine, it is also true to say that the vast majority of the world‚Äôs children also go to schools with little or no technology and it would be unfair and I think untrue to say that their learning is worse however poorer their opportunities.  I guess technology is an aid to good teaching, but not a substitution or a guarantee.9.  Worksheets support learning.  Again depends on the worksheet but generally I also agree with you here.10.  Homework is an essential part of learning.  Homework for homework‚Äôs sake no but those sts who read around a subject and do more than simply turn up to class and expect to receive all they will need their consistently do worse than those sts who do revise, read more and do extra work.  Perhaps this is where technology comes in to its own, allowing sts and teachers to continue the conversation outside the classroom without simply having to tick the school board‚Äôs homework box!A really interesting topic and I hope I haven‚Äôt bored you by rambling on too much!  I think very much that conversations like this will help us figure out the best way forward.  Thank you very much for the opportunity and I really enjoy your blog and tweets!All the bestAndrew Pickles"

However, I have recently visited classes with almost no structure and no expectations. The kids were slacking off and rude. So I would have to say that I disagree with number 6. Just because a learner (adult or child) owns and must craft the knowledge in their head, doesn‚Äôt mean that the learner is the expert in how to accomplish that transformation (learning). One example of how learner control of activities is a bad idea is the difference between preference and effectiveness. I have read that gifted students prefer structure and yet learn more in open ended environments while struggling students prefer open ended assignments and yet learn more in structured environments.I have had quiet lectures and activities (with worksheets, and homework) that were very successful (students learned) . I have had lectures fail (students didn‚Äôt learn). I have had noisy, open ended explorations that were very successful. I have had projects fail. Teachers need to constantly ask, ‚ÄúGiven the learning objectives, what is the best environment for the learner?‚Äù"

        "text": "This is well‚Äìdistilled list of challenges to some traditional assumptions.I like them very much.A discussion of each of them should advance any educationailst‚Äôs thinking on the key relationship between teacher and learner.  It would be nice to read an expanded discourse on each one, and perhaps put forward some models for a much better way of organising schooling.Of course, many of these arise from the compromise of the one-teacher-to-thirty-pupis arrangement.Being outnumbered means you either have to work hard as a teacher to control the assumed flow of learning, or you can centre the responsibility on each pupil. ‚ÄòSupported Learning‚Äô is probably a better concept than ‚Äòteaching‚Äô.The challenge is how to organise the key inputs from the teacher that are needed to establish the understanding from which individualised learning can build upon. I once observed a super lesson where the teacher would check the understanding of the class from time to time, and gather up any group of pupils that were less certain for a quick injection of teacher input, before they continued, allowing others to carry on with their learning the whole time.The statement that most relates to my interest is ‚ÄòLearning can be measured by a letter or a number‚Äô.Rendering the complex process of learning into a single letter or number is an accepted convenience at the end of a course (a grade ‚ÄòA‚Äô or a BSc, or an NPQH, for example) but during the process a profiling approach is probably what we should be using. The purpose of this would be to inform teacher and learning of the individual components that can be focussed on to improve the whole.I have written a little about this at my ‚Äòblog‚Äô at:  http://www.mikebostock.wordpress.com which is otherwise about the use of performance data for determing the worth of a pupil, a teacher, a class, or a school.Thanks for an insight into possibilities to do things better, and for provoking such an interesting range of repsonses."

The concept (albeit from a small, green latex puppet) of ‚Äòunlearning.‚Äô  I guess it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm still wrestling with what ‚Äòlearning‚Äô actually involves.  Where I am so far is that the people who need to unlearn some of the items in the list may not be able to . . . and maybe that‚Äôs because they‚Äôve stopped learning, well proactively at least.  Sometimes we do need to move backwards a ways in order to move forwards; these folks are doing neither, and that can‚Äôt be good can it?  So perhaps we need to aim to re-invigorate their thirst for learning so that the unlearning can begin?But unlearning?  Wonder where that will lead?  De-constructivist principles perhaps? Anti-social constructivism? Mis-behaviourism? üòâ"

What I have learned is that we must always be willing to challenge our own personal views on an issue for the sake of our students and customers. Our students are moving rapidly into a new age of learning and discovery. The needs of our students requires us to be fearless to make the changes that will help them succeed in their future. The use of technology is unarguable, but how we use it is still open for discussion. Research will be one of the keys to new technology applications in the classroom.From my own experience with out measured research, I introduced all my classes to Google docs last year and model how I used it  for all of my pursuits. Their response was explosive and immediately. They saw the potential and utilized it not just in my classes but in all their classes. Teachers were coming to me asking how to get it, how to use it and and could  I train them. Students were excited again and they( the teachers) saw the difference in their work."

I do feel school admin and districts need to change their attitudes as well in order to aide in creating an atmosphere conducive to this change in teacher thinking. We can liken this situation of traditional teacher thinking to that of a disruptive/spoiled child. Oftentimes, it‚Äôs the parents who enable them and the child doesn‚Äôt know any better. Yes, we‚Äôre adults and professionals and ‚Äòshould know better‚Äô. But, somewhere this behavior was learned. And, you cannot say these traditional modes of thinking are mainly those of older teachers. I‚Äôve seen plenty of younger teachers fall into these bad habits. I‚Äôd like to add one more to the list: ‚ÄòPowerpoints/Keynotes are not the panacea of teaching.‚Äô As with anything, balance  is important. Tech presentations can be powerful but, overused, can also be detrimental."

I informed them of my expectations, have tried collaborative group work (which was a fiasco both times I tried it), and have actually raised my voice this past week.  I‚Äôm at a loss. My first official observation was a fiasco as well, because the kids were not engaged, they were not cooperating AT ALL during their group work, and there were students hitting each other whom I did not see.

All the non-recorder playing ‚Äúgames‚Äù help stimulate even the reluctant learners but, without that practising routine, their potential is never reached. Parental interest and support can make an enormous difference for these children of course, but all too often these same children have  numerous other problems which are seen to be far more important than helping with what can be a fairly tough task!
