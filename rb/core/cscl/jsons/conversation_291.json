I wonder though if this could be possible with quarantine. If the seeds come from different plants but  but different plant from same species /family  would this be a fair test. I would love to be part of the observation of progress."

Should we do a plant that generally grows in most of the countries, or can we grow a few different ones? It would be a great learning experience for the children who are grwing it this year as well as for the children who will join in next year. After looking at the slide show, my children are coming up with the adaptability and usage of different plants in Australia. Our previous unit was on aboriginal identity and Brad (in my class) talked about a plant which was used for making clothes for the aboriginal people.  Children have started their own inquiries and it is amazing to observe their interest and involvement, more so due to the awareness of a world learning community."
