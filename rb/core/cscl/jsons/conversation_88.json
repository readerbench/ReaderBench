        "text": " Do you find yourself frequently shushing twenty-four children while one child speaks?  It is true that children need to learn to listen as well as talk. It is true that patience is a virtue. It is true that we need to teach our children to be polite and wait their turn. It is true that sometimes (but not always!) it’s worth everyone listening to what one person says. But…  Have you added up the number of minutes in a day, a week, a year, that all except one child in your class are passively waiting their turn, while one child at a time (or the teacher!) talks?  Have you considered the possibility that every idea does not have to go via the teacher? Instead of every child getting a turn to share their idea while the whole class listens, would any of the following work? Benefits: #1 in a series on making small changes What other ideas can you add to the list above? ** Would you like to contribute a post to the series on making small changes? Something we all tend to do or you have observed in classrooms? Ideas of simple ways to do it differently?  Submit     "
