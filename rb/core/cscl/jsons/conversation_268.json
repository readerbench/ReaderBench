We donâ€™t know and we donâ€™t (as yet) need to try to find outâ€¦ Our job is simply to create questions. We are each assigned a different lens through which to view the object and ask our questions. We areÂ artists, mathematicians, scientists, inventors and historians. We are encouraged to frame our questions conceptually.Â Considering the key concepts ofÂ form, function, causation, change, connection, perspective, reflectionÂ andÂ responsibilityÂ (key concepts in theÂ IB PYP) helps us to ask deeper and more interesting questions. Give it a try! I loved this activity,Â facilitatedÂ byÂ Helen Morschel,Â our workshop leader last Tuesday, for a number of reasons: No wonder it was so successful. Take a look at our schoolâ€™sÂ learning principesâ€¦ PS. Itâ€™s aÂ quipu. Go and do your own inquiryâ€¦"

So many good ideas get lost before we have the time to really mull them over and work them into our schema so they stay. Itâ€™s not because we donâ€™t have enough input, enough amazing things to learn more about, but because there are so many!"

I find it very encouraging that the strategies that I tried to use in my classroom are being used in the IB PYP schools. I am starting to see that I may need to try teaching again and maybe more teachers in my area will be open to these teaching ideas.  Thank you so much for posting such a positive blog about teaching."

I love when they become convinced of a thing and are adamant that they are correct until they are put in the spotlight with â€˜how do you know?â€™ I love how the questions deepen and the learning continues and a hypothesis is formed. I love inquiry education and learning alongside my students. It makes life so rich."
