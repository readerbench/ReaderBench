I often have a few half-written posts in the drafts folder. I usually have a few more posts writing themselves in my head. But occasionally, for one reason or another, I don’t feel like writing. I don’t feel like sharing. I don’t feel like thinking. Countless students in classrooms everywhere have days like that. Who knows what’s affecting their mood, their willingness to write, their desire to share or their inclination to learn? The difference is no-one’s going to make me do it."

Children who learn second language in school talk like parrots when they are in kindergarten, but they hav to absorb the new skills of reading and writing, are quite for a while as they absorbed new processes and basically got comfortable with new ideas.Having a silent period is part of the process. We all need to time to sit back, reflect and process. Just know it’s part of the process. Ellen"
